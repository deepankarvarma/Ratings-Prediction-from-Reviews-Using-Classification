Review
This used to be my favorite game and it is still 😅
"Every single time i put the online multi-player mode, it loads for a moment and then it tell me it doesn't detect an internet connection. I need my money back."
"Determined to make us watch ads! Wouldn't be an issue, but if I choose not to get rid of ads, it won't let me close it out! The sad thing...I have to watch an ad, to choose not to watch ads! Really?!? It's truly ridiculous! I'm not paying for the game. I don't mind an ad, maybe at every level up, but after every game?!? No thanks! I'll be uninstalling."
Super great running game
"Hello NetEase, I really loved the game it deserve more downloads, but please reduce game size and make it suitable for 32 bit devices. Thank you for your hard work!"
Assume
Then it used to be my favorite.but now it's full of bags and it keeps on logging out.it sucks.please fix that otherwise...
Nice game 🎮
Bkvas game hai 🤬🤬🤬
"My game didn't get back to my old progress , even if I connected it to my facebook"
Nice
Didn't able to download
Cool 🆒 😎

"This game is not good, in others mobile it is very realastic in mine very blury Lika a pixel game i was very sad my 2 GB Also over why to me 😞 also very lag when i race"
It's a game I guess
"It's a great game many characters, many gamemodes I have only played for while am already addicted."
"Its getting more boring, lots of problem are facing, my screen size just elongated after the new update!"
It's great so far my new favorite game on my mobile device
Nice work 👏 👌
"Fun but a few things should be corrected. The app should allow us to select ""custom rules"" while playing multiplayer, only allows that when you select the ""online with friends"" mode. Next, I cant play with other random players when i select the ""online friends"" mode. Also, we should be allowed to chat in game, there's only a drop-down of selected texts that we can choose from. And, we should be able to add random players as friends with just their name instead of needing a code."

Hey Sega Entertainment I have a concern can you make Sonic 1 & 2 available for offline use please

I really like this game

This game is very very good this is perfect🎮
Problem in pg shop when we sign in our email hi open Google not the game and game was not start
I'm playing this game 3 yr. and this is perfect mobile game I ever seen.
"Please fix this bug, in the blockman go app it says the game has more than 0 players but when I join the game it has 0 players but in the app it says like 50 players so pleaseeeee fix this it happens in games like The exorcists etc."
Interesting game
"This is a dishonest attempt to separate you from your money. An honest approach to selling the game would be to offer some number of levels for free. A gamer could then decide whether the game is worthy of purchase and buy it once. As it is, the game play encourages frustration to try and trigger a spending impulse. The open ended game structure is meant to keep a player paying and paying and paying. Stay away from this one."

Great game but they adopt the game similar to the pc version so it's kinda hard to play😋
cute game
"One of the best JRPGs, Controller works but give us the option to turn off the onscreen controls when a controller is plugged in"

"I purchased this game years ago, and never made any progress. I uninstalled the game. A few years later, I reinstalled and tried to play the game again hoping I would make more progress. I did not make any further progress. I struggled with the controls, the missions, and eventually because the game did not allow any progress to be made on my account, I quit and never played again. The game is no longer installed on my device."
The best game ever that I've ever played it so addictive and has a a lot of games the best thing is u can customise ur Avatar make ur own game and clothes
Why did you guys remove 2v2 😢😢😢😢. Game was gud when there was 2v2.
very good
"Solid port. Having played this game back in 1997 and having done 100% completion 20+ times, I appreciate the subtle improvements the developers made. I've put nearly 50 hours into this port thus far and it's dang near perfect. The only complaint I have are the controls during the mini games. Everything else works wonderfully."
I like this
Rubbish app. Can't even register a new account.
I love this game its Amazing
What used to be a good game has gone down hill with the introduction of ads. The ads themselves aren't so much an issue it's more that the game gives you impossible blocks so that you're forced to watched the ads in order to change blocks. Deleted
Very good quality
Its boring now always loses
Fun and exciting game just like the live monopoly
So cool but I was almost got aggron
Superb game
HATE ALL THE REGION UPDATES
Suck
Good graphics good fps good missions the game is good
"fun times 👍 greatest excellent, wonderful"
Getting banned is very easy. Simply disconnect for 2minutes or be removed from the match because of riot server and wallah... You've been banned for X amount of time.
Good
Amazing always

I'm currently trying to get the game back but it won't install
"It's Sonic for the phone, what else is there to say! It plays well and looks great, just like it did back in the day. You do have to pay for the full game eventually though but it's worth it if you like Sonic."

"Amending my previous positive review. Climbing was doable before. Currently, the duo lane has either Tristana or Caitlin for adcs. Everyone else gets stomped. Was on a 5 game lose streak trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Then, I got placed in the infamous ""playing above your rank"" queue against a bunch of masters as an emerald. If I'm playing above my rank, why am I losing? I am sitting on 42% win rate while getting put in ""playing above my rank"" every 3-5 games."
"The new production team is rubbish. Only know how to increase the prices. Events are useless.To get like 1 incubator/normal ""blue"" kit need to play 120 - 600min. Incubator only shows the blueprints if you not top uped.(I spin 60 -80 incubator vouchers but not even got a single blueprint) *Game getting harder for mobile players and they forcing to mobile players to play with emulator players. Help team also just faking. They don't even read the message. Just send pre created messages."
"I played for 6 years on other devices and just got mobile recently, it's not as good as console and PC versions of the game but it's good."
Perfect 👌
Hey people if this app keeps on crashing in your Android phone just turn off your wifi
The game was very nice game 🎮 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"I am a returning player and after leaving the game for nearly 4 years decide to come back but I have problem installing it as it is telling me to still delete other app to install, but i already have deleted 8gb for it. I don't know much space does it need to run when I have 9 gb available can you guys please fix the issue fix it."

Very nice 👍 game i love to play
"The game at lower levels is luring and habit forming. At higher levels, no matter how many chests you open, the algorithm will not let you upgrade any card to level 10 or above at least not the cards that matter unless you purchase something from the clash royale shop. It draws unbalanced game for you to finally make a purchase for good cards. Fraudulent by design. They think people won't understand their trickery."
Ok
Nice experience
Good game and graphics but whenever it comes down to racing if I race against somebody and they disconnect is voice the race and nobody loses but if I'm betting a lot of money and I'll lose connection y'all need to correct this!
Great .
"So i downloaded this game and what i found out, the Graphics are good but the gameplay and controls are just boring, you just have to tap tap screen to fight and it's boring, you can't move freely like to jump/crouch/ move backward/forward it's just tapping the screen. Good game but make the control and gameplay independent"
Great to play when you have a downtime
Paid for the game and all the extra is just more money not cool.

"I love this game and the graphics etc, but ive been crashing for no reason im using a Galaxy A13, All the graphics are low and im still crashing how do i fix this."
Very fun to play but beware! It's addictive!

So I've been having a problem I'm trying to use a custom skin and it's not working it says that's in a Minecraft skin silly I know the skins are in the right format because I've used them in the past I know this is an app rating but I can't figure out how to report a problem on Minecraft so this is the closest thing hopefully somebody at Microsoft for some reason gets a chance to read this please see if you can fix it
Valo
Please I can't open an account with this software
Nice game
The app works pretty well with the exception of allowing you to switch to another app and switch back really quick. If you start an online game you need to stay on the app until the game finishes or it will likely crash. Everything is great though
"Review: They broke their own game since 4.0 its either we have more problems and or recent problems have not been fixed (server lagg ms spiking, black screen loading issues etc) I love this game but now I understand why it's rated so low league of legends is better optimized Riot if ur not serious about wild rift why waste time fix ur game plz server lags... loading screen issues things that make the game unplayable we just want to be able to Play the game we can't fix it that's ur duty"
"Worst PvP experience ever. I waited around 30 min & couldn't find a match, not even a bot. Matches with real person are very laggy."

"The games awesome like well done,its also different and its like anime but, I keep on encountering hackers every ""ACE TIME"" which is really unfair!"
The best game ever you get to customize you avatar in the game but sometimes the game has alot of bugs but the game keeps shutting down on every weekend and i wonder why can i get an answer David baszucki aka (owner of roblox) 😁👍🏾🤝

"The game frequently forces you to buy and spend to offshoot the purposeful sabotage the AI during autoplay (switches players so they can die or before making critical combinations), slowing gameplay to an impossible craw when attempting to play on your own. Setting matches up for failure. Speeding opponent response and actions while slowing or inhibiting personal moves."
Can we play this game with keyboard and mouse
Ta fantastica essa

"A super great game, I'm very, very satisfied"
It's ok 😊🤣
super game Love you
The best game ever
The graphics are very good. There isn't much of a story after level 27 I like the controls which are adjustable. The problem is that you do not Advance after 27 level. And I've been playing for 3 years and they have not opened the 4th planet yet..other wise you play the same missions and arena with friends...its a winner in my book
Trouble loading right off ! Hope it improves.
"I'm having fun so far. Fun room-based danmaku roguelike. Could be good, so a hopeful 4"
"There are increasingly more players who either really doesn't know how to play or are trolling intentionally to lose matches in 2v2 mode, some even maliciously abandoning the match It would be great if the game offers a merit system that allows players to block users who constantly abandon the match or troll in matches. Would increase the gameplay experience by a whole tier and save the frustration of being put into the same team as ill willed players."
Game became p2w
Great entertainment
This game is not that much good.. but I better can play mlbb online game.. but still I give 3 start for this game cuz it is kind of boring...
Rockstar has fixed the game! On Samsung A30s (Android 11) is working
It's a pretty cool game but the ads are like so common
"Not gonna talk about the game itself here, I instead want to focus on this game as a port (OG game's a 4/5 by the way). This port is amazing. The controls are smooth as butter and it even runs on 60fps! The physics were also tweaked upon for smoother gameplay and it's stellar. The smootherSpecial Stages, widescreen, new characters-- truly incredible port. Good job to everyone in the team."
👍
"Unfair, this game uses no actual chance. Seems like everything is predetermined. Would be a nice game if each roll was actually left to chance and not some silly unfair algorithm."
still playing so far good. Furthermore I have much to say but for now will leave it as is.
$30+ worth of gems lost in game and customer support responded saying tough luck. TERRIBLE - DO NOT PLAY OR SUPPORT THIS GAME / COMPANY
"Sudoko is better than this game ...what the hell is wrong in this game ? When playing the game, tasks are coming and game will be pause again and again .."
Op.
Worst game ever
A classic!
Very interesting game. It is very imaginative game .I loved playing it .I think temple run 2 is better than the one
Too many cheater. All of them livestream with mod apps and not banned. Dev must ban them or balancing the mod if it permitted.

Laggy as heck bruh
It's Always keep logging me out and the quality is blury even tho i already turn up the graphic 😭

Changed to one star
"When using the power up options that require you to watch ads, there are several times when you can't exit out of the ad at the end. You restart the app only to find that the previous ad viewing doesn't count, you're subjected to the same ad again, and on and on it goes."
Really loved it

I don't normally rate games but the market system on here is appalling. Revert back to the traditional transfer format.
"This is Amazing the controls, the frame rate but. It has adds though it's perfect for classic sonic fans."
"This is very serious the control are normal and steering control are normal too but everytime i go to the car the wheel turn left or right, the steering is weirdly turn left without pressing the left button steering, can you remove this bug on mobile it's kinda annoying to do the mission, like racing missions"

"Great game. I especially enjoy the events and there is something to do every day. A few weeks ago I even got the 180 day login badge. I've wanted to spend some money on because of how much I've been enjoying it, but this being my one issue with the game, even the cheapest options in the shop is very expensive. My guess it's probably because the prices are being converted into my local currency. It would be nice if there were more affordable options though."

Great game from looks to story and gameplay I still love this game but they need to change the teams system so it's easier to remove inactive players like the Homescapes game has
Very fun

"Would be cooler if there was some goals to achieve, or make it so you can unlock boards and tokens, the prices are to much ....just wow...SMH...but great game otherwise"
It's awesome but there is updates if you dont play for awhile
Only for Chinese

"Im getting really addicted to this game because is so fun but my only complaint is that when your at the higher levels of the game is that when you upgrade your resources, army, defence or your traps it takes way roo long to upgrade and your town hall and clan castle. On your other side the other village the one across the sea they way too low money when you've been waiting hours but i honestly love the game"
Game is not installing please help pls
"A bit too luck based, make it more so you play a deck and win by skill and not by one single luck based thing. Make it more so you can Max out a deck and play with it so you dont have to max new cars every time when balance changes happen bcz its pay to win. Diamond pass + lvl 15 makes it toooo pay to win. You should atleast make Diamond pass the price of gold and gold half the price of its original due to the release of lvl 15"
Best game
This was alot of fun til the moves became impossible. Oh well it gives me more time to do other things now!
"I like this game as graphics are next level and you feel like they you are playing on a hig end gaming pc. But the only problem was that this game has too much voices and the characters keep speay all the time so, sometimes it becomes a little bit irritating so I think you should improve this. Thanks I like the game. Piyush Raut"
Fortnite is really diying all I say is that just Improve the gameplay
Great game time spent well enough but need to spend lots of money than efforts
Unbalance team. More bugs. Frame ping 999 . This game is created for peoples autism. Don't make time for this hell . U regret for this .
"This game is good I like it but how can we do split control in this game I wanted to play in split control so, please add split control in the game. I'm giving it 5 stars for its performance"
Like this game
its nice
It was really addicting when I first played it but they killed it off although it is starting to get better now
Slots are less to update Can only update or built 1 thing at once Time consuming
Please remove ADS from game. After the watch ads game is freezing some time. More optimise the game for low end devices.
great game just some cards need a reworked
Excellent 👌
It's a game I guess
I quit this game because so much bug and glitch because of glitch my broom and ice iron sword and 19m coins got scammed its skyblock i was loving this game but now i hate i got scammed atleast 30-40 times my id name-Chalizard_yt
I don't normally rate games but the market system on here is appalling. Revert back to the traditional transfer format.
I bet you will be boring after some days but those some days will be so fun
I'm thinking if we can be made much more a lot more easier instead of being so hard & difficult all the time ...
Awful game. The original monopoly rules includes that in 1 turn you can buy only 3 houses or hotels. In this version as soon as you get 3 or 2 of the same colour you can buy hotel. Makes the game unplayeble ... I want a refund as this isn't monopoly like this ...
Love this game

"Mobile legends sucks , keep it up League of Legends 💥🔥💥🔥💥"
"The reason why I download the game are because of the mech, I'm a mech lover enthusiasts and i can say you guy did quite good with the mech in this game. The mech is awesome but there is still need some improvement on certain way. But, that its, just the mech that are good because the rest of the game are kinda average or meh, just full of typical online mobile/pc game elements that are made in asian, not in bad ways, mostly. To be honest, is a good game but there is still need some improvement."
Amazing I've been playing since alpha
"The game size is so large now, pls give us an option to lower the app size. Add a global chat so that we could interact with other players. If mobile legends is copying your content then copy their marketing strategy, start collaborating with stuffs like anime and Netflix shows, make the game eventful, let us have an interactive in game event during eSports events. Start advertising the mobile scene in SEA! START ADVERTISING LIKE A MOBILE GAME NOT THE SAME MARKETING STRATEGY ON THE PC GAME!!."
This was a good game until the amount of cheaters in pvp made the game unplayable. very disappointing.

"This app was my favorite of all time I had 10,000 as a high score. I paid for ad free gaming experience and you make me still watch ads, deleted my high score, and now the game keeps crashing no matter what I do. I love this app but I may go find one that's not a money grab that's rigged for you to watch more ads then you play. I recommend the older version of this app but now I would not recommend this at all. I am sorry but please fix it. If I paid for ad free gaming it should remain that way."

Too many bugs after the update sometimes All servers are dead they don't open only Asia work sometimes 50% bonus fame don't work after watching the ads fix this
Nostalgia
i love it i meet new people
Very close the the PC version and great gesture control.
"Will ruin your phones screen. Permanent giant blue blocks top and bottom(left and right horizontal). Lack of options to fix it and make them black or changing. Also color is blue, the worse color for phone burn in. Controls are also clunky and respond slightly off. No easy controller support, or cheats. Just no encounters, nothing else."
It's a game I guess
I love this
"From 5 star to 1 star, i can't even play with 4gb or 6gb ram, to much lag even with low graph n fps. It's worse than before"
Good game

Best game everrr
"This is a very good blast from the past! This is good I won't deny it. But I liked it more when it had the D pad, I tried to spin dash away from a incoming projectile but the joystick registered it as jumping so I jumped into it and since I had no rings and 1 life, I died and got a game over. Please go back to the D pad as the joystick isn't reliable"
Is good game😃😃😃😃😃par PLS free pass of skyblock GEVE VIP sword Free
Very op game
I love this game finally I've reached legend today
Worst game
I need help omg the app is glitching and I tried to uninstall and reinstall but it's still the same glitch page.
Ok
Its soooo much fun once u start playing u cant stop
The game is great with just enough of a challenge to get you to think and plan moves.
"Lately the app has an extreme lag! I used to really enjoy playing, not it's just frustrating."
I can't even login to my old account which I used to play with a vpn. It keeps saying unable to connect to server or unable to login to this region and when I tried making a new account it told me I could play in said server and when I pressed login same thing again with the new account
👍 👍 👍 👍
This was the most googest game I've ever played
Oh my childhood.
Game is great but very hard to play and understand
Mind refreshing
I'm so happy 😁😁😁
This game is nice but there is always a noob team and very strong opponent. Very hard to win in the rank matches reaching gm and challenger.
Very very nice game

"The game is so buggy, with every path they release, more and more of the game before unplayable. Their recent update broke the voice chat and keeps turning off the voice chat for users. It only fixes after restarting the whole game."

Really good game has one problem I can load some of the races pretty bad things never get fixed I been waiting for 2 months for it to get fixed
"And now after the latest update.... the game closes out and shuts down when I try to download all the resources, maps and all the essential downloads. This is bull. Thanx allot."
"Server always down and getting fuel is a mission with no connection.game constantly offline and when I updates profile, you lose all the money you've accumulated.it sucks!!I'm so close to uninstalling the game.please fix it"
Amazing hut plz make it so u can return items plz

Game is very good but on Android playing game crash problem face many time please fix my phone Android 13 6gb ram but why game crash .
Just an amazing game
Fun!
Can you please add beast Gohan summon pack
"Amazing game give me huge nostalgia of those ps2 era when we write cheats on paper or play it in those gaming cafe/small shops around neighbourhood, there are some things which needs fixing like the broken textures, audio issues etc though they aren't game breaking so you can give it a shot specially after the recent update game no longer crash on latest Android devices. (Will update this review as the game gets updated)"
It just gives an error about upgrading to the latest version when I try to sign up.
The bugs are just what ruins the game but like everything else is really good.... Hope u fix the bugs this update :)
Beyond quality

So fun
OG gangsta' game
It's a very good game in playing this game is very useful because it depends on your strategy In making your strategy you have to use your brain in when you play making more in more strategys you become more smart (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)⁠❤
It is very good game
Great game to play when shopping with the wifey. Lol
Wish you would earn legend tokens for the cars you have purchased and trying to restore instead of cars that you are not currently trying to restore/have purchased. They make this game so you have to spend money.
Fake advertisement fooling people nothing special in game
Love the different summits
Why now QQ International cant log in? Please fix it and update it. Thx

"Great game when i was a kid I grew up watching Pokémon and buying the pokemon cards as a kid, now i can play and catch the same Pokémon i saw on TV. I like all generation that have been released so far in the game can't wait all the shiny Pokémon to introduce. can't wait for more mons introduce especially the new megas"

OOO
It's fun
Its so funny
This is a good game but today my game is not opening 😟😟😟😟😟😟😟
Game keep crashing on login screen.
I'm the second legend
"Don't buy this on mobile, poorly optimized, clunky unresponsive controls and poor framrate/random frame drops damn near make the game unplayable. I can't accurately stepcount, reliably set up skips or do certain other things needed for speedrunning because this runs so badly on mobile which is a big time deal breaker."
Nice great
I always pay the game as long that I enjoy it but this one after playing online multiplayer it suddenly freeze and I can't go back to game. I know that this game have a lot of potential please fix this
not a bad game and i love this game so nice😊
Updating my review. Always been my favorite game to play. Keeps me busy and doesn't get old. They have fixed all the crashes that used to happen and have even the updated the game to make it even better!
Good game and graphics but whenever it comes down to racing if I race against somebody and they disconnect is voice the race and nobody loses but if I'm betting a lot of money and I'll lose connection y'all need to correct this!
The connection is always a problem even if your phone's network is working at very best the game will still lose connection
🖕🏻Update🎮Lucifer(^_^)SG
Best
Juicy
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUN;)
There's so many problems trying to open and play the game. I already knew they sexualize some Pokémon. But in order to get credit for playing with Pokémon you have to rub it sexually. I think that's called grooming. I will probably be punished for writing this. They will make game harder to play and will have a harder time catching and getting shinys

I don't care about the kissing skin I downloaded Roblox because there is a GameOn
"It is a great game for really active or casual play. It's nice to play a game that makes you want to get out. It was something fun for me and my family to get out and do together. It's made some very fond memories. *Update- I still enjoy the game, but am dropping a star due to their problematic events. The last raid Elite Raid wasn't even available in the city I was located in. Casting populations of players aside is a slap in the face. Hard enough to get out an participate while working a job."
Slice and dice
controls are great. childhood game.
Amazing game and it became my favourite so this game should get 5 stars
Excellent experience 👌🏻
Perfect
Good 👍
Napakaganda ng larong Ito

TIER 3 SUBS ARE SIMPS
"I Find the Game Incredible everything feels like a wonder but when I'm about to fight sometimes the game turns black and crashes when the fight is done usually I'm dead or either knocked due to a mecha,player or the zone.I really Enjoy this but with all these bugs I have to delete this game untill these are fixed"
I love the game the animations are so good!
feeling like katrina with no fema
"Feels like a lazy emulation port. Ratio not adapted (huge empty spaces on side of the screen), virtual buttons like on emulators. Not what I expect from premium games, especially from a game released what, 20 years ago now?"
Very fun
Good graphics and good and smooth driving overall good game
It is soo fun
rubbish login & recovery system
So the game is fine. Here is the real issue. The dice algorithm is complete trash. I tested this over 20+ games. You land on go to jail an unusual amount of time. On several games it took over 10 tries to make it all the way around the board and pass GO. Almost always land on go to jail. I actually can't play and enjoy the game because I am in jail almost every turn. Graphics and animations are nice and the menu is simple. So I gave 2 stars for that reason.
Edgar is way too OP And i got team by frank who stuned me and atacked me as well as pam and i was in the middle stuned
Good for the brain.
Its amazing to play it
I love it
Love this game as an Anime Fan this game brings me the joy that it Dragon Ball/Z/GT and Super in the palm of my hands
Diss game was fair good and I love the store for some gamers is it good for you
"Slow and laggs alot , it's sad cut I use to love this game"
"A pretty good port, but the controls make anything requiring precision IMPOSSIBLE. For example, trying to sneak past aeris. Game broken."
Wort game ever you bully me way to much and its ridiculous and I can't take it anymore
why there is no op items why!!
brilliant game love it
I give it 3 stars cuz 1. It lags so badly 2.it keeps crashing 3. its floating mid air so i cant move 4. The mecha only show its legs please fix it pleaseee
This game is sooooooooo much FUNNNNNN!!!!!
"This game is good.the guns are well designed,the hub and also all the buttons and stuff.it is a very good game.can you add like some crouch button.it will add some life and challenge to the game.it will be a great game."
Nice
I lost my game progress again and again
Noice great game
"Dear Roblox, My son Andres wanted to login to his account, but he forgot his password. We tried email, and phone number but nothing works. He is logged in on his Xbox though. But on his phone tried many times to login. Now we are doing the verification process and we did it right all the time, but it won't login to his account. We don't want to make a new one because we already spent money on it some times. Please try to help me reset the password. From Andre's parents,"
Does this version have the speed boost or just max everything i rather do speed runs since i know the game inside and out. Always a fun play through regardless though.
Why im being penalty as a afk im just camping now my reward has been deducted

"The theme collection $35, too high. $10 for sure you can make more money than restricting it with that high price. The inc one beautiful || The account option is good,but for a game that has no score or statistics it doesn't make sense...please add that feature to the Sudoku ver that really needs this to be able to play it on more than one device and keep the progress.I would like to play that game on another device, but for now the lack of an account is forcing me to play it just on one phone."

This game is very very good this is perfect🎮
Please riot allow to use costumize icon like our picture. I am pretty sure that it will be a big impact for players.

This is a good game sometimes it keeps stopping but its a good racing game but can you try to add like other cara for example like in mercedes tey to put a amg gt black series and the toyota try to put a gr yaris and the events also rally events to that will be more exciting thank you
Fabulous good quality of graphic design and excellent quality of fps in game. 😎😍👍👌💯
This game is nice
Very fun but infuriating and tedious at times
"The concept of the game is awesome. Thank you for inventing it! In the improvement later on, your game is only getting worse. As a fellow game designer I hope this feedback will help you: - Advancing mainly add hp and dmg(by items, levels...), creating an artificial (P2W) bar stopping advancement - The strongest powerup are the starter ones, so your chances get weaker as you advance. Edit: Sent an email months ago. Got no answer. Reducing a star"
It is super fun but I don't like how you have to have stuff to actually play a match
Best game bruhhhhh
ओके
A good game
You're difficulty levels are clearly rigged.
I thing there is something wrong with your game because when i try to enter the game it says error I try everything to open the game
"I keep getting heartbroken but yet I keep on playing. Simple, yet effective."
Awful game. The original monopoly rules includes that in 1 turn you can buy only 3 houses or hotels. In this version as soon as you get 3 or 2 of the same colour you can buy hotel. Makes the game unplayeble ... I want a refund as this isn't monopoly like this ...
Good game put one person would leave and then the game is stuck and ruins it for everyone else! Replace them with a bit or something? Maybe even a 30sec timer unless they are making a trade or house mortgage! Or I get stuck and can't press anything!! FIX THIS BUG SO EVERYONE CAN PLAY
Brilliant
The game is very good
Love it
Try
Very cooool game!
I would like to do 5 stars but the game is a bit glitchy somehow when I complete a mission most of the loot I pick up is just gone
Too Many Ads in free version I Recommend dont install this Ad Game
The best rpg game i have ever played since 1997
Its ok but not that good
"I absolutely love this game. Mechanics and battling take a little getting used to, but honestly, it's an amazing game."
Fun with controller
Hard to update
Fun
OP GAME
BR
Bad game. Stiff controls... They don't allow us to use 3/4 fingers and they don't allow us to switch the controls to our liking.
I used to play a lot like everyday.... But since last update game crashes a lot and not working properly unable to connect.
The free version is 90% ads. I understand paying allows for the ad free version but this free version is unusable with the time wasted waiting for annoying ads to finish
Best game

"After spending too much money on the game, they decided to suspend my account claiming that there was a violation of the terms of use(cheating) knowing that my account is new. Knowing that I do not have any high fusion cards and I could not even finish the last tower WLT so how could I be cheating?"
Great fun game need more love players!

This game is lovely
This is a 10/10 to me
It's good quality and game play
Waste of time
The new update removes the stuff that are very valuable leading to unrewarding results for the cost

Greedy update
Awsome
Was hoping to play with a cousin of mine but it won't let us saying that we are in different platform. We checked the versions that we had and it is the same we tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it doesn't work. We are both in mobile too.
Amazing weapons! 🤨
Good game playing 2 years
"Controls are way too messed up. I tried, but nah. Uninstalled!"
BEST GAME!
The game is very boring now. Some level are just unbeatable. Can u believe am still stock in a level for more than a week now. If something is not done about this I will just get read of the game and download other Fruit crush game.
"Best game for android phone, a must have one for playing many years continuously. It has issues, but support works, and developers are doing good job."
"The best MOBA came to android! Here are the pros: 1. the gameplay, it's very dynamic and interesting. 2. optimization, the game flies at 60 fps even on budget phones. 3. Champions, there are many of them, and all have their own unique story. There are no cons! Thanks to Riot Games for the mobile adaptation of the original LoL!"
v good game
Love it
The game is good and can be pretty fun to play with friends. One problem I have is all the changes. Getting rid of the boxes was a horrible move and unlocking characters is really hard now. Boxes were also full of surprise too and you could unlock alot of things that you know have to buy. Overall good game but I dont like the new layout and features.
"fun times 👍 greatest excellent, wonderful"
Wow this game is so cool I love it so much
Lots and lots of fun.
It has built-in update service other than Google store
Nice game 🎮
Definitely not have that anime ai

"Sad to give less than 5 stars but the game is crashing for no reason and only started crashing a few weeks ago. Also, I wish the new buttons added to the bottom of the screen could be moved or hidden."
You can hack the game and play as super sonic
Best game and this game to win easily
The story line is good
"i had a very good experience with asphalt 8, and asphalt 9: Lengends just made the gameing experience even better. The graphics are awsome...... I dont have any words for this game..."
This is simply the greatest game i have ever played
The best game
"Paying for ads? I paid for no ads, yet I have to watch an ad to rotate blocks. This is fraud! In order to achieve a high score you have to rotate the blocks. The game play anticipates rotation based on the next blocks it displays especially when the screen is full. These ads are not random, it is programmed this way, there's no way they have this many programmers working on this simple a game. You truly suck Zynga!!!"
"Good game I've been a fan of mk since it first came out, after 20-30 fights in faction and survivor mode it stops"
Itsood I've been a sonic fan for a long time and this brings back the good old memories
I got this game via Play pass lucky but I think it's not worth buying otherwise
Most fun & enjoyable game
Okay
Most fun shooting game I ever played on Android. I like the haptic feedback when u fire a weapon.
This games is very interested and l am so happy in this games

Why playstore devlopers didn't say about this app recently. Because this app isn't real. Besides there is a new version of this app. Why playstore didn't release update ver. of this app?
New update 3/27/23 sucks. The tabs across the bottom have been elongated in Android visually a step back need a cleaner UI this one is a mess so much I almost want to uninstall I've played since the beginning
Always a great game
Hello Bandai Namco Developers your game are so awesome and interesting that I have playing from 5 years but I have one request form you that can you bring more dbz or dbs games plz plz plz bring lot of love to this game From India👍
"Great game! But the problem is Dev's have stopped actually updating the game, so no new content for players to enjoy."
Nunca saben como balancear un brawler
Keep stopping and turn to the homescreen. Unable to load.
I give it 3 stars cuz 1. It lags so badly 2.it keeps crashing 3. its floating mid air so i cant move 4. The mecha only show its legs please fix it pleaseee
IF YOU WANT WASTE YOUR TIME FEEL FREE AND INSTALL THIS TRASH GAME
I wrote password and name created Trainer Club account and won't let me in.
Worst experience ever. After new update it is not opening at all and 'wifi error' message poping out and although I have connected to wifi network the game data is not downloading and it makes the phone run slow(although I use a snapdragon 870) that if you want to close the game it is not closing and display touch sensor also not working.Fix this soon enough and update it.
Finished the game
"Started playing free fire in 2018.I left playing ff in 2022.It's a trash now.Everything changed.I wish one day garena will turn this game to it's old version where there was no lagging,no ping issue,no exit of factory rooftop,no pay to win,no chances to get old items back just peace."
"Idk what's yall done to this game but wow dude I can't even load it on a $1,000 phone brand new an ot won't load I have Uninstalled an re installed this app an always gets to same place an stops I got over 5 grand in this game over the years an its all gone cause It won't even get past downloading assets on load up screen"
Dhd
Mind that older review I made. That was my brother. But in my opinion the game is a great recreation of the older games with nice quality of life features that honestly make it more fun to play. I obviously can't critique it as if it were made today. So I'll review it on how fun it is.
Nice game haven't been online for long time ot has changes but good things love this game
Annoying
Wild wrift=after update black screen My regard Multimillionaire company riot games 👍🏻

Very fun and addicting

"GREAT! So far. UPDATE: This has quickly become one of my favourite games in this genre. Apart from the great graphics, intuitive and easy to use controls, smooth gameplay and a whole host of of game modes, it is utterly addictive and F2P. Yes, there are ads but you get rewards and there are plenty of other ways to restock on gems after you've just shelled out for a 10 spin. Of course, if you wanna pay, there's plenty for you to choose from. Either way, this game ROCKS!! BEST GAME EVER!"
Not the game that I played in my childhood
Fun and very enjoyable
Fun game
"I had this game it is so fun ,but now when I download it again I can't load my account although my account is on my email 😔 please help me"
best game ever
very nice game
It's good I a good game I have a blast with my kids.
decent game but it's insane how much space it requires/ takes up in your storage and the ads have gotten way too excessive.
it won't Let me export my custom skins. It just says they're not skins at all and it's getting pretty frustrating
Good thing you have a special event called Battle Day so that we can have horrible lag in every single game.
"Disgusting experience with this game. It's full of bugs. But even if you ignore bugs, its impossible to play without a group. If you use a third party software to finish raids which are basic things then they slap you with a ban. Thing is in my country they dont even give enough pokestops and gyms also for people to play. They did nothing to improve the game. Concept was fantastic but implementation was drastic. Most important thing, their approact towards their CUSTOMER is just pathetic."
"I thought it offline game, but it's using data 😩😩 Please you guys should upgrade this game."
Ah no cierto
"im really getting tired of trying to logging in and get w failure to authenticate message. ive tried 3 different ways to log in, uninstall and resintalled the game, turned off and on airplane mode.. and signal is not an issue..please fix this!!!!!!!!"

This game is really good.
Update is terrible!!! Much harder and easily get wiped out of chances because if location of squares. Have played this game for years no I think I need to move on. Update hardly lets you get a decent score!!!!
"Till the best game i have ever played , just perfect game but there are too many missions that are very easy but overall game is amazing"
😻😻😻 gorgeous...👻👻 wanderfull gemes
Great game but can have some crazy annoying glitches though
Worth it !!!
super
Very good game i love this game
It's totally bad 👎
Awesome game and I love It
"This was a fantastic game.....until I was about 5 hours in. Suddenly I was having to make in-game purchases to get the items necessary to advance. Instead of being fun and relaxing, it was stressful and frustrating. How sad."
FORTNITE IS THE BEST CUZ U CAN NOW PLAY IT ON MOBILE AND U CAN MAKE FRIENDS AND FORTNITE IS A GAME FOR CHALLENGES
Still love it after playing for years.
Best game ever my favourite mini games is bedwars and it is very popular you can customise your character which great I love the skins lovely grathics
The controls' hit box are misaligned and misasigned and the UI has a lot of graphical glitches. You're better off going the emulator route.
I love this game it's just that the sides of my tablet are broken so some times it is hard to play the game
Best fighting game ever
Fun
My I'd get hacked
This game make brain to think clearly
I like Minecraft but I spent 4.74 just to make me uninstall Roblox and I will not uninstall Roblox just to get this game
This game is awesome 😎👍👍😎

Good game Having fun
Problem in pg shop when we sign in our email hi open Google not the game and game was not start
两年多不更新
"Not gonna talk about the game itself here, I instead want to focus on this game as a port (OG game's a 4/5 by the way). This port is amazing. The controls are smooth as butter and it even runs on 60fps! The physics were also tweaked upon for smoother gameplay and it's stellar. The smootherSpecial Stages, widescreen, new characters-- truly incredible port. Good job to everyone in the team."
I LOVE FREE FIRE
Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this game!!!!!!!
Nice game 👍 everything is good 😊
Game is good not like adds but i like this❤
I got banned for not playing for 1 month why I'm not a hacker or Moddershall player unlock my account
Been playing on and off for years. It's not bad but could use some updates. It freezes and at times when you need extra life's it will say you have no Internet connection even though you have a great signal. The newer version with the animals helping it's cool. Overall not a bad game to pass the time.

Best mobile game ever! Just a beauty of a game.

Good game
"It's a fun game, but I bought the ad skip, hoping I didn't have to watch 30 seconds of ads just to rotate a single piece, and it didn't work. Still gotta watch an ad. The problem isn't the ad, the problem is have to watch 30 for every two when I'm trying to build a nice combo and can't turn the piece available to do so. Would like my money back if it's not going to do as advertised please!"
Can't installing when ever i update this game after full download installation is completed plz solve this issue
It awesome❤🤘🤘
I found my best second game and my first is mobile legends bang bang
This game is Soo good I don't have any words to say.
Great 👍 👌 👍 👌
"This game is good but lots of problems in this game like suddenly crashed game, bug problems. Developers please solve these issues."
Remove this double key event because we collect keys for privileges but our keys is wasting in lucky draw Or we can't get privileges for three days so remove this event 😒😡😑🙄 So I'll give four stars ⭐
So brutal this game
Stupid apps
Very good game i love this game
This game is lag in 4gb ram device
Nicè
Super
worst match-making. no fun at all. one sided match all the time.
Good
The on screen buttons only register my presses half the time. It's really awkward and frustrating to play because of this. I keep trying to push the A button to progress the dialogue but it doesn't register my press so I keep pressing it from different angles until it does. I barely played for a few minutes before giving up because of this and I'm genuinely considering getting a refund. But I also want to try and make it work because I've heard good things about this game :(
Awesome my fav game
I love 💕 it
super great 😍😍
Good
"""I playing this game. This game is wery good. Her graphics ,guns,cloths ,events, etc .Every thing is good t"
Nice game
This is very good game
Good game
It's Always keep logging me out and the quality is blury even tho i already turn up the graphic 😭
Like this game
Why can't DONWLOD?
"The company makes odd decisions about which Pokemon to release and when - new Pokemon games are being made faster than Pokemon are being added to Go. Also, data compiled from players shows that the quality of in-game purchases has been consistently dropping while their prices are increasing. Finally, they ruined their own postcard system by tying it to scattetbug acquisition. What a gross and dumb series of choices by Niantic. Atrocious."
"Nice game and it is so much better than dragon ball dokan battle ,the character like ultra are a bit expensive but i got the new goku black ultra . i recommend this game for the players of db dokan battle"
"Everytime I get a 0-0 tie I want to kill myself Ties are gone New update as of 3/27/23 - absolute trash, after playing since launch will finally uninstall this game unless they revert 2v2 game mode."

"Played this game for years. Loved it so much, even paid for the ads to be removed. I get you need to profit from it more but this is not the way to do it. The stars are distracting, the powerups are a scam, the frowny face is straight up insulting. This game makes me feel kinda depressed now. I can't even to begin to express just how disappointing this game has become in less than a year. Zynga is quickly killing off what Gram Games perfected, all in the name of capitalism."
Sucks
This is really fun I'm gonna lie.
tanginaka
You need to buy the game and then on top of that everything else costs as well. Wouldn't purchase!
Very easy game

Am giving this a 1star because I cant download it into my phone again which I waisted 2.23gb and later came out failed
Very good ☺️☺️ game 👍👍👍
good
A very buggy game. Cannot be played. Always shows data connection required. Even after complaints no solution for this. What is WB doing? I should say don't play this game and should be removed from Play Store.
Good....But on chromebook its really laggy like I cant play it and I'm missing OUT Dx
Can't even play a full match without it timing out or crashing.
Life simulator
🥳
Nice
Loved the port. Would buy again
Didn't able to download
Really enjoyed it i was talking to the people I've infected at this stage of the world book welcome to them to football now and I am sure they have to be on the 3PM and I am sure they will be able to get a boy
I love this game because its really well done 👏
VERY ENJOYABLE - GREAT OPTIONS - NO BUGS

Very fun to play
"Es buena y entretenedora, me gusta mucho"
Very good game i love this game
Rubbish app. Can't even register a new account.
This game all good but now version totally upset me because of the bug and I can't play peace fully suddenly exit please fix this problem☺️
"Despite your game recently including the HP Overflow as a useful ability the wheel that spins after taking damage and defeating a boss still sometimes gives you extra health when you do not need it nor can you use it. This is useless, pointless, and frustrating as a gameplay mechanic. Please make an improvement to this."
Not bad at all. Takes some time to load but otherwise pretty decent game.
I can't get it to work says that the expansion file download failed
I cried myself to sleep because of this horid game
"I enjoy playing this but everytime I do it has a notification of ""downloading additional content"" that only goes away when I force the app closed."
is cool but what I don't like about it all of the furniture I app is making the grass and everything go blurred and then when every world I download on addon it say sorry there's a new version of this world and when I press ok and then download the new world and it said the same thing over and over and I download a new world on addon but it still said the same thing I keep downloading world on addon but it did it again thats my No. 1 hated about this game.
It is a goated game play it now it is going to be the best game you ever play.

"Ads became more aggressive now. They pop up even if I don't want to see them. Cars bought with money are more powerful than earned. Not to mention it takes forever to get a car by playing. There are some bugs with the auto-drive, crashes the car for no reason. Have to wait 3 hours to play with the only car in higher class just once, then wait again 3 hours. Police cars; unbelievably strong, too powerful. Multiplayer car dividation sucks, can't use your best car to climb rank. Asphlt 8 was better"
It's Always keep logging me out and the quality is blury even tho i already turn up the graphic 😭
Magandang gabi poh PUBG MOBILE nagpapasalamat ako dahil binago nyo yung pubgm sa mga low end. Nakakapaglaro na ako ng maayus smooth na sa OPPO A5S. sana naman poh wagnyo nang baguhin always na ganyan para dina ako magquit. Kakainstall kolang kahapun. Ngquit ako dati dahil madami bug at napakalag nya at framedrops laroin. Sana naman wagnyo baguhin napaka smooth na sya ngayun. Yun lang poh samalat
It's a great game I love it but sometimes in the heat of battle the games starts to lag which causes me to die and also would love to see a unwatwe mood or Mecha to make it diverse great game tho🫶🏽🫧
"I love this game so much,its so fun!but my screen is so shakey,i am my brothers sister who is typing this for him,he stressted because his screen keeps shaking randomly and i try fix it but i dont know how his user name is Saksi123_qhs or Saksi_123qhs,please help,thank you☺"

Great entertainment
"great game, having fun."
Awesome fun
It's super good but how do you Join out dated Servers?!? Please answer!!
Love the game and graphics. The only reason i uninstalled it was beacuse it had no story line so it became boring and monotonous after a while
Greatest
Nice game
It has built-in update service other than Google store
Awesome
ILike It
This game is full of bugs in every update we have to face new bug.
SUPREMO
Supadzzzzzzzzz♧♤◇♧♧
It is a super fun
Was a good game however the newest update made it crash upon opening the app.
Lit
"Great game, obviously, but a tough buy on Android because the game might close if you have to turn the screen off or switch apps, and save points are often very far apart. I lost an hour of progress once and then moved my save file to the pc version, which i added hd sound and graphics mods to, then streamed it to my phone using Steam Link and a controller. Boom, better experience than when I first played it on the PS1"
Sonic is cool and I beat sonic 1 and on final zone was pretty easy after I tried and tried again.
Ok
Fun game
I like this
This game is lag in 4gb ram device
amazing just I LOVE IT
"Hands down graphically the best fps game also in tps . It's incomparable in terms of gun skins, character skins ,vehicles and special abilities in the name of classes . Even if you are a f2p , you won't be disappointed . If you are pro then you can get gun skins more easily . But this is a highly data consuming game . It's take about 30gb when you down all resorces ."
please bring cho gath in wild rift
This game is really good.
The game is fun
I really wanted this game but it doesn't even download can you pls fix this problem?
Dis is good game is Roblox ban scammers and hackers pls
This app is the best 👌 all my friends are talking about it

Nice game
roblox is the best game ever ive played this game when i was 6 now im 15 love u roblox!
"After playing the game, yeah the change it's actually good... Anyways add more quest and reduce the time to have quest c'mon this isn't clash of clans, it decreases me to want to play this game."
Good game pla
Wow nice game
"after the latest update i can't match up or even play pvp why is that? i downloaded all the resources i still can't match up, what do i need to do? please fix and respond"
"Other than the game bugs, the game is ok. Though, after some time, i started seeing more bugs. I've reported them and, there weren't any changes. For example, there's a bug where you can't continue your mission. Some others...include player's being restarted to the login menu. Game nice, although 👍"
Nice game ⭐ ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐ ✨ 5 Start
To many paid add ons (2 star) *Edit forced ads killed the experience completely!(1 star)
"When yall gonna do something about the hacker issues, such as kralj in NA and monkeyking in Asia smh"
"The game is perfect, the gameplay is fun, all the mechs and pilots are are unique and fun to play. But there's just one thing the game lacks, it's exposure, like, please for the love of God get a sponsor so people will see and want to play the game, the concept of the game is amazing and fun, I'm sure if people see's an ad of this game, they'll be interested to play. I just want more people to play the game so we all can have more fun playing here."
Good
Very nice game
Rad game I like everything about it especially the battle Royal and please in ur next update can u guys make the save zone more like modern warefare's gas n give us gas 👍
Why don't you put CR 7 for above 110 ovr
Was hoping to play with a cousin of mine but it won't let us saying that we are in different platform. We checked the versions that we had and it is the same we tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it doesn't work. We are both in mobile too.
"I Find the Game Incredible everything feels like a wonder but when I'm about to fight sometimes the game turns black and crashes when the fight is done usually I'm dead or either knocked due to a mecha,player or the zone.I really Enjoy this but with all these bugs I have to delete this game untill these are fixed"
Love this game I have been playing right from the very first game starts

The old PUBG is good but now this PUBG mobile is bad not 🚫 good
nise
Useless app
"I'm only giving 3 stars. ⭐⭐⭐ Why? For me, I don't think this game is really professional, yes it's for kids, but there are lots of adults on the game. I have a few issues that I need to point out. First of all, it needs internet. Honestly, when I'm in the car and wanting to play Roblox, it tells me I need the internet connection. There should be a feature where you decide if you want to have internet or not. And when I'm in a game for 2 seconds, it kicks me out when my internet refreshes. Fix it"
I can't play it in my 512 mb ram phone.It only run on the lobby and it crashed.when I try to start a match it crashed.you should reduce it's file size and make it sweetable for lowend devices.
Brilliant
It is very nice game it is very interesting to paly
"I like this game because this game graphics, cars, racing tracks and car upgrading is excellent."
Finally works i can play games just fine now
It's a really great game to play
"A really great game totally my no.1, but I do have some suggestions, like Dev's should add rapid fire or other modes into ranked mode, cuz then we can have some fun"
Great game to considtrate
I relax playing for hours
I'm only have to use it...
This version is 'too' old. Ps : According from Tencent CSR
Qq差死了和微信一样的差送了封号
"The game is so buggy, with every path they release, more and more of the game before unplayable. Their recent update broke the voice chat and keeps turning off the voice chat for users. It only fixes after restarting the whole game."

Too few PokeStops to justify how many pokeballs you lose while looking for Pokemon. It's like the game is trying to get you to pay

"ggs, I gonna upload this gameplay to my YouTube Channel named GAMER FOREVER."
"This is utter trash. It used to be good and the mechanics are balanced but the grind is flat out ridiculous. It has gotten so p2w that pushing in ladder is impossible. I am a f2p with king tower 14 and ""max"" level 14 deck until ofc level 15 comes. EA looks like an angel compared to supercell."
After some levels game is crashing
So I just started playing so I might change my review later but so far so good it is a great game.
I cannot download the game. Something is wrong

Superb
"Very fun mechanics, fun, and innovative game! Overall it's great.. however, sometime there will be projectile that encounter your hit box without them touching you. If you're low on HP you'll die because it registered as a hit. In higher chapters, it's more detrimental because the bosses (or even monster in general), deal 3000-5000 (where I am currently: Chapter 12)"
Gg
Version too low to login when i installed most updated version from play store. What a joke
Oum.....the game is good
Avhhhh
Loads up then goes back to my home screen after a minute 😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬

"This game is great but make sure you don't pick up strong boxes in missions cause you need to pay real money to open them. There are no adds you are forced to watch. The game play is alot of, muliplayer is alot of fun. I do wish you could replay the campaign whenever you want."

Awesome my fav game
This game was very interesting. 🙂
Too many ads in the ad supported version. After an ad plays it pauses ur game an then it plays an ad whenever you try to un pause it.
"Will ruin your phones screen. Permanent giant blue blocks top and bottom(left and right horizontal). Lack of options to fix it and make them black or changing. Also color is blue, the worse color for phone burn in. Controls are also clunky and respond slightly off. No easy controller support, or cheats. Just no encounters, nothing else."
The game is great 👍👍👍👍👍👍😌😌😌😌
The sniping people is a great experice
"Pointless the game is to repair the property not obsess over the dog this Need's to be redone with strict tasks the exclusively in the aid in the rebuilding of the property grounds only, I thought this game was called gardenscaps not"" waste the whole game on a stupid dog"""
"Very fun game, Love 💕💕 it."
"If I could give zero stars I would have. I couldn't even play the game because it kept saying internet needed something like that but I have wifi and it was on, going to uninstall.not keeping a game I can't play"
Nice game 👍
game closed within first 2 minutes refund

"It's an amazing game, it's glitching alot especially when I'm fighting in the top 10 or I'm firing at an enemy. Please 🙏🏽 can the glitches be fixed. The freezing got even worst after adjusting the graphics lower."

Too many ads. Can't click anything without an ad
I can't play it in my 512 mb ram phone.It only run on the lobby and it crashed.when I try to start a match it crashed.you should reduce it's file size and make it sweetable for lowend devices.

"recently switched to a much better phone & the download/install problems i was having since update at end of july have been resolved. great game & looks beautiful on my huawei honor 7x. still some lag & freezing when there are multiple mecha onscreen, that's the only thing keeping me from giving 5★."
Grate time passer
So far I'm having alot of fun. A classic retro fantasy RPG greatly made into mobile port with no (serious) bugs so far. It is also my first time playing this legendary game and I'm so happy to finally play it! Thank you Square Enix! You guys rock!
Loving every minute of this.
Got stuck on level 339 no matter what I couldn't get past it. I deleted the game.
Love this game
Good . More Lives please ...new update is cute .
I thing there is something wrong with your game because when i try to enter the game it says error I try everything to open the game
"Worst game period ever, this game is slow divisional is stupidness gameplay horrible. Gameplay is awful they cant pass a ball properly they can't shoot the right way this game is thrash total thrash. They need to allow people to play the game freely an stop interfering my Gosh this is sickening mentally. This game should be ban, throw away in the garbage."
Too many ads
keep it up more events all good
"Fine game. Highly competitive, really futuristic in an acceptable way, fine characters, diverse and customizable weapons and so on. I love d game. But thus game is one of the most unoptimized game I've ever played. I have deleted pubg and cod, but left this game, because it is, to me the best mecha game on mobile. But it skips like crazy. B4, it skips after a number of games, now, one game is enough for it to crash my phone. It too bad mehn..."
I love this so much
Ked si dam head to head tak vždy keď dam match a som amateur II tak mi da iba typka s 134 ovr alebo 110 ovr
Cannot install the update.
I love the game but it's a nock off of roblox but with a Minecraft look and it's also a fortnight nock off cos they name a game fortnight. Every fing else is amazing 👏
Unable to install after every update. Please check this glitch
Great game. Though the updates can be a big cut in your data
Dainamic game
It is an osome game
"The game is great! Tip for everyone. Do NOT spend much money here for skins. There's no way to get your account back if you log off and you must link it with another social media platform. This game does NOT have it's own login platform. There's also NO way on getting support in regards to your game account. I have spent quite a lot of $$ for the skins. Logged out and now I'm fd. I have my username and password, but how would you login?? You can't ... So, be aware..."
Those randoms are trash af the worst game in ever played and I hope all the randoms die tmr
Bro I got banned from the game even though I didn't hack in this stupid game. I wish you could give 0 stars and if you get better they think you hack wow very good game
"No adds, love the game, and teaches you. I love it!"
Roblox Is Better
Super sonic primer
Best game
This game is superb
The new changes and updates made the game worse. I've played this game for many years and this was disappointing.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

"Installed the game played about 1 hour, now the game gets stuck on verifying files start up screen, after a minute message comes up saying to check my server Internet connection? All other games run fine on my device, very disappointed Deleting wild rift"
Hein Min Oo
Edit may last review been many update and cools stuff going on hope you need to do something about lags.
I have been asking for weeks to delete my save on the game but still nothing has happened and nobody has contacted me about it. Why write in help if nothing will be done. Still waiting and it's been over two weeks since I first asked. I have sent my ID and I don't think I had it reset before. I have been asking for two weeks now and still nothing
love this game that's all I gotta say
This is game cool and more cool
Naic
It would be good if you can separate the offline and online because it's just annoying when you have a low internet and the game keeps me quiting
The game is known for its movement god level
"My game didn't get back to my old progress , even if I connected it to my facebook"
Good game playing 2 years
This game is the omega of all games (except roblox) but when I get sad I play kick the buddy and it makes me feel better and laugh 3 stars but ADS are a pain In my butt y u bully me and WHY U AD ADS JUST TO ANNOY ME!?🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 I WAS gonna ad 2 stars but I'm generally nice so 3 stars

"Fun game but unfortunately while it is rated PEGI 7, my 8 year old son can't play it on his tablet due to not meeting the app age limit of 13 years old min. Please make age limit clear - he was very disappointed having cleared other apps to be able to install."
Very bad game
"Please stop advertising other games, it's annoying."
"Best game ever, now in your pocket"
It so relaxing and fun
ITS A VERY GOOD GAME NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ALL THE CHARACTERS I WANTED BUT BECAUSE ITS MY FAVORITE ANIME AND HAS THE THE STORYLINE IN IT ITS PRETTY FUN TOO

Really good game in my opinion. You can do whatever u want. Very nice game.
I like the experience but I have some thing that always stays and stops my gameplay
"Best game in existence. I hope this game continues to exist in the future as it's the best game ever, if I had to choose one game for the rest of my life, it would be Minecraft!"
Really good game

无法下载最新版本
This love 💕
"Awesome game! Have been playing since my childhood on a board and now playing globally with many players. Last played was on laptop but luckily this game ported to Android, never think about that but still the graphics are good, the gameplay and the UI is good. Hope to get a option to reduce the graphics with something would get the game to vast majority of people and if it is free to play will suggest others to play this game. But the game is p2p and the in-game items are also p2p is not good."
GREATEST GAME IN THE EXISTISTANCE OF STUPID PINK TREES
This game is lagging even if I have a good signal this is outrageous you got good internet and then it's says lost connection
It's okay
suber game

I would like to do 5 stars but the game is a bit glitchy somehow when I complete a mission most of the loot I pick up is just gone

Good
"I love this game! Great for killing time, relaxing, or just working out those puzzle muscles in your brain. Edit: I enjoyed this game more before the recent update. The frowning emoji face is an obnoxious aspect that feels out of place. I already know I lost, I don't need a frowning emoji there to manipulate me into feeling worse. Definitely not a good addition."
Good 👍
This game is addictive lol
Good
I liked this game and I hope to Stat and more updates
Very easy game
Wow u guys increased the size of it

Time waste money waste this game is scam your game account suspended and sell your game account in another site please 🙏 don't play

"Worst game. Rigged matchmaking. I did an experiment. Built a deck only good against the 2.8 hog cycle. Haven't seen one since. 100% rigged don't play this game. If u do, dont give them you're money. Bad faith game makers."

Good Game for Relaxing
Gd game❤️‍🩹 I love THIS game more then my bf😌🤟

It's a very good game in playing this game is very useful because it depends on your strategy In making your strategy you have to use your brain in when you play making more in more strategys you become more smart (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)⁠❤
This game is amazing 👏 😍
It keep kicking me I can't play anymore and also the missions are hard like the racing ones
"WHERE is the tutorial to explain what all the stars/extra pts are for? NO Settings? I agree with another reviewer that now it feels rigged. SUPER Glitchy. It suddenly stops & the sad face pops up, when I CLEARLY have more available plays. I tap on the rotate, reverse or delete, & they often say, ""Ads Not Available."" Repeatedly. No matter what I do. Another game lost. I've tried clearing cache & checking for updates. There's NO ONE to contact about it! It's the only game I played. FIX IT!"
Catdog
Very nice game absolutely amazing
"Worst PvP experience ever. I waited around 30 min & couldn't find a match, not even a bot. Matches with real person are very laggy."
One of my favorite game
The best game ever that I've ever played it so addictive and has a a lot of games the best thing is u can customise ur Avatar make ur own game and clothes
Nice game
Its compelling in game sense.
"I've had the game since beta. It was my favourite for some time but has had absolutely no development since than. Would enjoy new maps, new missions etc."
Dawg I get stafted
The ads are a bit annoying but every thing else is actually fine!
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Was a great game been hacked and full of cheaters big don't play
This game is so bad im trying to get trophie but everyone is temaing please make so its possible to report!

"Just one thing, controls lag a lot especially while defending and tackling. Very bad matchmaking, u always face a player who is 2/3 divisions above u, not your equivalent!!! This game has one of the worst online matchmaking process out at play store."

Nice game and I love you
No filter for iranian player
Too many bugs especially after reconnecting
Good
More Grate Graphic I sugget!
Best game forever
More fun! Watch video to get free stuff! Love it. I was going to delete but I changed my mind. It's okay for now. But too many ads trying to get you to buy extra rewards of stuff!!!!! You should get a reward every time you complete a level.
"Sometimes framerate goes awful, and sometimes the signal is awful, but if youre wondering about the signal im using a wifi which could run any video at full quality and doesnt buffering"

My love pubg
It keeps saying loading player data on every game
Very nice game 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
"Always Loved Final Fantasy Series. Loved The Original And The Remake. Just Sad 😔 That The second Remake Will Not Be On The PS4, Only On The PS5."
"I really like this game... It is cheesy, but oh so fun. The developers put a lot of effort in to weapons making it enjoyable to rip the aliens in pieces. I wanted to play games with a Controller on my phone. Started downloading every FPS game I could to see if I could use a controller. MOST GAMES DO NOT. SGL ran with the cotroller flawlessly, and months later, I am still enjoying playing the game. I wish development had not halted... I wish the maps could be customized... C'est la vie"

"My wish if natural motion add some gold keys in weekly Elite cup, Because getting gold keys is very very hard, impossible I love this game Nice graphics ✋👋 keep it up developers Valentine's day, Christmas, Halloween etc events should be added if possible.... Otherwise over all fantastic game 👌👍🙋🏻"
Brilliant
"I enjoy playing this but everytime I do it has a notification of ""downloading additional content"" that only goes away when I force the app closed."
Fun interesting unique
"This game is obviously beautiful but for one level we get only one star but how come for to do list we need to spend 3 stars 2 stars for one activity That is not fair For example, for installation of statue, spend one star. It should be like that. For each and every activity u need to spend only one star. Decrease refilling life time also i.e., not 30 mins. Reduce it to 5 mins."
So good i love it
It's five stars I'm to lazy to say more
"Not sure what happened recently. The game has issues loading, causing you to close the app and reopen until you get in. I'm missing raid passes. The trading system is a little messed. My husband's phone will be done with the trade, and on my end it will still be thinking(we both have a brand new samsung galaxy s23 ultra). And there are way more people spoofing/cheating and nothing being done about it. There's enough real money being spent in game for these issues to be fixed immediately"
Cool
Best game bruhhhhh
"This is the best game, I have ever played every time I open my phone it's the the number one app I touch and it's also allows to play with friends and family if they have the game, creator's sure worked hard and it was worth it"
No one can trust this game.this is delicious 😋 game
Bhad me jaa
Fix the chat it's say exist illegal chat please I gave 1 star if this dont work that's why don't give garena this thing I say can but it's say **N I say car it's say **r please fix this problem

"Old time classic, wish it supported stratus xl controller natively. Works great on G Cloud max settings."
I think it is the best game in the world
It is a good good game I would like it a little bit more if it had 2 plear but its bay my ferret company i like hay day but clash of clans is better From Quincy Spick Gorter Burrows

"I used to play this game on my Nokia 10, and it could never be better, now on Samsung F13 with 4 GB RAM, I can't stand the lag, LAG IN FRUIT NINJA? unbelievable"
Gardenscap Kenzileah Adcbef
Please add controller support and make players who play with controller play against people who play with controllers too And instead of just tapping the screen just add dedicated buttons for the diffrent attacks please
"Not bad, great A.I., graphics look good, though all the tokens make the exact same tapping noise, and in general, very blah sound all around. Not sure why anyone would pay for extra for tokens that don't do much other than look different. ""Auction only"" is the most skillful way of playing, but the variation is less than the previous developer for Hasbro that did a better job save for the A.I."
nais
This is the best mobile game it's not perfect it has its flaws but it's great
Add morocco number 😤
Good
まいかたけかさたまひ
Game super iam sooo happy😎🤣😊😁
"Few things... Laggy, has you watch ads for extra exp but rarely awards it, sometimes you find a chest but you can't open it, prices for items are stupid greedy, maps are tiny and look the same, character customization is super limited, all your items are stuck together in the same bag, there's no way to separate what you want to hang on to and what you want to sell, constant coverage of the screen with messages with no way to turn it off. Could've been super good..."
"Hey, the game is awesome, But one flaw. I playon a chromebook and it's a little hard but thats all graphics are great and the game runs smoothly"
i tried downloading 4.11.0 update from app store and installing latest update but the installation can complete give me always.dont know what to do.please developer help

Its mwah!
Game of the year guys💀
Minecraft does not work on the the type phone I have.
Great game
This game is awesome😀. I have never experienced such game ! I am now a fan of Dragon ball! If you ask me which is the best game for dragon ball. I would say this! And it would be better if you provide a summon where we can get 1 tag unit with one ticket and that one ticket is only recieved once by login and twice through event.
This game vgood ilike it
Worst game ever in the history of play Store
"Im getting really addicted to this game because is so fun but my only complaint is that when your at the higher levels of the game is that when you upgrade your resources, army, defence or your traps it takes way roo long to upgrade and your town hall and clan castle. On your other side the other village the one across the sea they way too low money when you've been waiting hours but i honestly love the game"
Good
"I grew up playing Final Fantasy. FF7 was the entry that got me started in the franchise, so this is extremely nostalgic for me. The android version stays true to the original playstation version, except for one or two added optional features."
It's so good
Great game lts go for super sonic
Very good okkk
"Ita amazing all around, one thing I might ask for would probably be more maps, but that's just a personal gripe."

My favorite RPG game of all time! 😊
Can I play without controller or keyboard in Android?
It bad.
"The game was great at first. It was only half pay-to-win, and really great. But, since the update with no more boxes, now you can just buy as many tokens as u want and get literally any brawler. I give this 3 stars only for the fact that once was a good game."
Fun
"The good: The game and all the minigames are fun to play for months. The developers keep expanding the game. The bad: It turns into an idle/login game grindfest for weeks or months at a time once you get past the first 15 or so levels. The ugly: The ad removal battle pass is a 2 week subscription service, costs more than most other games, and can't be purchased with in-game currency. If you spend over $50 on a mobile game, you shouldn't ever have to watch ads again."
So fun
Almost out of beans! I Need side games so I can win beans. I can't have fun without beans. Please send Royal Meadows ASAP. Thank you Jessie
I am completely stuck on level 57 as there is not enough moves to complete the level. At this point I have tired 50 time and I still can't do it. What should I do?

And After the player-killing event come out there's a lot of them out there, and the report function just a decoration (it does nothing).

"i can just say ""best video game"" for mobile"
One of the most worst football games. I would rate it -5. Because VSA never ends. And I would have scored more goals and it says time up to me and gives 10 secs more to the opponent and he would tie
"This is the best game now for me... I hope in next update this game has have a multiplayer because it's fun !!!! Ilab, it"
Worst matchmaking at all
I playing this game from 6 year I love it

"I don't understand what is happening with my game. I have an issue where it says ""This is not a Minecraft Skin, silly"" even though I know it's a minecraft skin. It always worked fine, yet I also have an issue where I can't download MODS or SKIN PACKS since the game doesn't want to open. I did all I could, no progress, and I DO have the game bought and it always worked. Please, do something to fix it if possible, because the game's unentertaining otherwise. I can't even play with a friend."

"Pointless the game is to repair the property not obsess over the dog this Need's to be redone with strict tasks the exclusively in the aid in the rebuilding of the property grounds only, I thought this game was called gardenscaps not"" waste the whole game on a stupid dog"""

"An amazing game, but I'm having a little issue with my friends joining. I can send an invite but when they accept it, it tells them that they're unable to join and I'm usually on wifi. I'm not sure if it's my Minecraft doing that or there's. Is there anything about that that can be explained??"

"It's a direct port of the original, as far as I can tell. It's fun, good party management and customization. I'd never noticed before this playthrough though, but is this a ThunderCats game skinned over with humans? It only sounds crazy until you see it. The character models: Cloud/Lion_O, Aeris/Cheetara, Barrett/Panthro, Dune Buggy/backwards ThunderTank, Hades (and several other Summons) Mum-Ra, Bone Village/Mum-Ra's tomb, Rocket Town Rocket marked ""Shin-Ra"". Airship/a Go-Bot for some reason."
😨😨😨😭😭😭😭 Sosat
"I play this, i dont know what is happening in the game becoz the game dont show the how to control the player just showing the some special attack info"

"touch controls go out for no apparent reason, will make long progress just for the controls to go out and have to start all the way over from a save point is very frustrating. ""auto-save"" doesnt exist, it just lets you upload saves from a cloud. unless your playing this for free through the pass i DO NOT recommend buying."
Pay to win bad👎👎👎👎👎👎 I love game 🎮and I'm so not happy
"The game can be potentially similar To borderland/Destiny on Pocket Mobile, however, this game is really Lack of Creativity, Idea of Next Content, and many Basic simple thing that can creates an amazing RPG Shooter Game. For example, the Legendary Gun in this game is just same exact gun from any other rarities, but with more perk, and reskinned. They don't do anything special, literally functioning like any other gun. I have so much idea to improve the game, if you interested, contact me."
It's a good port but the controls are a bit clunky
Love this pls download
You should fix the add issue and you can see everyone's reviews
I am completely stuck on level 57 as there is not enough moves to complete the level. At this point I have tired 50 time and I still can't do it. What should I do?

"When MASTERING materia in a weapon/armor slot, it will no longer allow you to remove it. It was fine in the beginning, but started to notice this at the very end of the game at the Northern Crater."

Continuously getting worse and worse monitization-wise with an overall well made set of bones.
Everytime I try to install this game I select wifi and right after that it just says install again.. it does this again and again and it's almost like there is no downloading it. Please help

Good
a piece of SHlT
A very buggy game. Cannot be played. Always shows data connection required. Even after complaints no solution for this. What is WB doing? I should say don't play this game and should be removed from Play Store.
Love the music and sonic my friend in 2nd grade LOVES SONIC SO MUCH and now I'm in 3rd grade But can you remove ads CUZ I HATE ADS NOW ON YOUTUBE IT'S OK BUT WHEN YOU CAN'T SKIP THE AD or if it's 1 HOUR AND I CANT SKIP man I'll kill me

Game is good but it lags during pvp battles. Please fix this issue.
Nice game I play this in my Nintendo switch

My phone is 120 hz but why 90 and 120 hz is locked
Overall good game but my only problem in this game is the game optimization.
So nice pls the green sign and black screen problem solve plssss my id name is PSG ovr 108 level 17
Ive been playing this game every day for years. I paid for no ads years ago. I loved that I could play it offline. The updates over the past year made it online only. Not good. Uninstalled. Recently reinstalled to try again. Ads. I paid for no ads. Rating dropped to 3 stars.
I am the game puzzle king
Really nice and good but I don't know how too find more mission
What happen to shadowgun deadzone? I would literally buy the application if madfinger still had it available. Where ya at deadzone?
aku cinta riot
It's really good
It's not an offline game then why it is offline category
I'm thinking if we can be made much more a lot more easier instead of being so hard & difficult all the time ...
My son loves it
"Nice game. Good communication with the support team. The game is developing and adding new features throughout the years. Melinda's wheel isn't working for me. It says that I had like 5 free spins from using energy, but I didn't receive them."
it's very good game
I want sonic exe
GREAT GAME !!
Its so cute
why there is no op items why!!
So far so good
Unalive yourself NOW
Good
নাইচ
Absolutely love this game!!
"The game can be potentially similar To borderland/Destiny on Pocket Mobile, however, this game is really Lack of Creativity, Idea of Next Content, and many Basic simple thing that can creates an amazing RPG Shooter Game. For example, the Legendary Gun in this game is just same exact gun from any other rarities, but with more perk, and reskinned. They don't do anything special, literally functioning like any other gun. I have so much idea to improve the game, if you interested, contact me."
why i cant register while i'm in europe i use my cellphone number here and i dont know why they can't accept my registration please help me i like to play one of youre game that i see in youtube but they need this application for the account on games. thank you in advance
the algorithm unfairly matches you up with players that are higher or lower ranked players!!!... The playing field is not always fair!
"amazing but please stop messing with the mech updates and stats its actually getting ridiculous how much the devs change how fast they move, health points, shield points, and even damage points."
Good luck
The game is so cool and graphic is so cool
Nice op

"This game is very good. It allows you to build your creations, play with other people and socialise and more! It's a great game for my children. With the new exciting updates, I can ensure that my children could play."
gay
Fortnite is trash
Mind that older review I made. That was my brother. But in my opinion the game is a great recreation of the older games with nice quality of life features that honestly make it more fun to play. I obviously can't critique it as if it were made today. So I'll review it on how fun it is.
👌👌👌 👌👌👌
It bad.
I do not have any daily gifts I hope you can fix this glitch
good game
good
Please add 3rd party controller supporting
"The in game purchase needs to be fix, it keeps saying the app doesn't support billing payment"
Worst game ever
Ben 10 characters should also

It's the best mobile gta game you'll ever get but there're some minimal lacks in it which can be ignored..... Waiting for GTA4 to play on Android

"Definitely one of the most in depth drag racing games I've ever played on Android. Especially for free, with very limited ads. Tons of real road cars, upgrades, and simulation based. I love it so far!!!"
Worst game. Eats lots of memory and hangs frequently.
Nice Holi update
SUPREMO
👍👍
Op game bro full dbs story not 100% real story but 99.9% story
This game is awesome
"Very good gameplay, best mech battle game and satisfies all happy trigger itches!"
It's so beautiful
"Everything is pretty great. Only changes I would make is to incorporate a leaderboard and ranking system, but also to decrease the costs of the other boards and pieces. If the extra boards were 3$ and piece packs 2$ I would be way more inclined to buy them. But the 5-7$ price is too much that I haven't purchased any extras so far."
It's amazing. The game just plays amazingly. My only thing is I wish I could play Final Fantasy 8 like I can play Final Fantasy 7 on my phone. It's a perfect Port of Final Fantasy 7 to the phone and it plays really well.
Very nice game
"I am writing a review to say that I don't much care for how the 200 levels are panning out. It's hard enough with the limited moves but it has added a countdown that takes away your progress if you do not match. I'm not spending my hard earned money on a game, so since that seems to be what these higher levels are all about, pay, pay, pay, then bye, bye, bye!"
"rag doll game that feels like a old flash game Full of ads, no way in hell is this game worth 40$ a month"
This is a pretty good game I give a 5 star because it has the perfect rating. It deserves 5 stars the perfect.
Good game
This game contains virus as when ever I download it my phone get switch off
Best drag race game!!
Good
Awesome game
Nih game lawak amat tiba tiba fps down kalo enggak jaringan merah tanpa sebab

"Im really starting to get irritated by this game....the first time I got an authorization error I lost my account and the second time I got a authorization error I haven't tried to deal with it because I was scared that I'll lose my account again,soon I logged in and I was surprised that it didn't have the error...I had no difficulties...but guess what....all my game data was gone!!!!!!!!!!!all my characters and guns and everything I worked hard for was GONE!!I give up on this game 👎"
Sega startup screen then black screen.
Please enable controller support and the option to remove buttons from the screen. Over all great game
👍👍

"Lately the app has an extreme lag! I used to really enjoy playing, not it's just frustrating."
This game is the omega of all games (except roblox) but when I get sad I play kick the buddy and it makes me feel better and laugh 3 stars but ADS are a pain In my butt y u bully me and WHY U AD ADS JUST TO ANNOY ME!?🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 I WAS gonna ad 2 stars but I'm generally nice so 3 stars

Please remove this app from playstore. No point if you not allow people from oversea to register.
That is so dad
"An amazing game, but I'm having a little issue with my friends joining. I can send an invite but when they accept it, it tells them that they're unable to join and I'm usually on wifi. I'm not sure if it's my Minecraft doing that or there's. Is there anything about that that can be explained??"
The best war game on mobile phone ... I love the zombie as well ...
Good
I LOVE IT SO FUNNY THAT I EXPLODED
"The in game purchase needs to be fix, it keeps saying the app doesn't support billing payment"
This game is Amazing ❤ A great game so far. It will be better if we can select the map.
I downloaded this game for younger brother. And it's awesome 👌

"Dear Roblox, My son Andres wanted to login to his account, but he forgot his password. We tried email, and phone number but nothing works. He is logged in on his Xbox though. But on his phone tried many times to login. Now we are doing the verification process and we did it right all the time, but it won't login to his account. We don't want to make a new one because we already spent money on it some times. Please try to help me reset the password. From Andre's parents,"
Really like this game.
Merit system doesn't fair keep your merit system goodbye im deleting this game
"This is nice game, but its ruined because the boxes were deleted."
Entertaining. Very fun.
Worst game ever in the history of play Store
Ads ruin everything!
I rly love the game but the thing is I have every rare and super rare brawler but now the chances of me getting a brawler are less than 1% that's terrible pls help me supercell I rly want new brawlers but it's way too hard to get a brawler. Let me tell u how hard it is. So I got the brawl pass season 12 and I'm on like lvl 65 and I still got no brawlers from it pls I'm begging I super cell help me. Thank you.
Bohat mast dada
It monopoly alright

Just another way to play my favorite game! The only baffling thing about to port is the fact that you can't speed the game up.

"Bro asphalt,you have just made a game with the beast graphics on mobile📱 hatsoff. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩"
Worst game ever

Best game ever
I really like this game
This is the best Game ever
Okay
Sonic x tails Sonic the hedgehog TM classic 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭 I'm so sorry I'm embarrassed so please please I'm so so so so so and there is I'm very very very embarrassed about that I'm so sorry Sonic and tails so please forgive me I didn't mean to do that I just brainstorming so there's 100 or I mean 500 words so I'm just going to say this like 1500 times I'm sorry I'm very very very very sorry about that look how much words I'm saying it makes me too much and I don't know what
Amazing game you can do a bit of waiting but still amazing. There are no ads so you can on to your next battle quite quick
It is good but very few mistakes your games
Pathetic game interface
I liked the game quality and its graphics cool
Go to beach
Waste of time
Very Good
"This game is just pure cool, with a cute little sonic and friends,He is ready to defeat Eggman!"
"Never trust a game that has a financial interest in your failure. Sooner rather than later it will force you into a corner and make you fail so it can earn money. This game does exactly that, by reducing randomness of the pieces it gives you to work with. After a while you have no choice but to lose and then they can offer to bail you out by forcing you to watch an ad. This game was a lot of fun about 5 years ago, much less so now."
"I played 1010 nearly every day, until we purchased new desk top computers a couple of months ago. I have not been able to even install the same edition of 1010 since then. I tried to install, but there several other editions out there. I dislike any and all of them. I just recently was able to get the original version on my phone, but I really enjoyed playing the game on my monitor."
Op gme
Goofy
Good game
I like the game but theres one problem everytime I play the game for a certain amount of time the game closes me out instantly but it's not a bad game just fix that then it will be great 😃 it happens every time I play for 5 minutes the good part is I still have all my progress so I can just go back into the game when it closes out. But sometimes after it closes out and I press on the game it loads for a second then I closes out so I dont know why it does that but it's still not a bad game.
It's real mind relaxing 😎
good 💪💪💪💪💪
I Love the Game
非常差劲的体验
This game is so fun bro like I literally got so much legends in this game
"It seems to run fine on my oneplus6t tmobile version however even with a moga bluetooth controller the screen is still letterbox blue background with those ugly control overlays present. This is a deal breaker. ePSXe and retroArch emus already have multiple resolution options on mobile. This port has NONE. Ive requested a refund. A phone is small enough. How to we enjoy the nostalgia with that horrible overlay and letterbox? The control overlay still crosses into screen, Y not fullscreen then?"
Awesome game!
Downloaded tryout ended up playing for hours straight awesome RPG hooked already
Thank you minecraft update
"I am loving playing this game on my mobile phone. My only issue is I am not able to use Phoenix Down. It targets to alive characters instead of the KOd characters. Is anyone else having this issue? Also, when cloud is on the motorcycle escaping Shinra, the speed is crazy fast, almost unplayable."
Love ittttt🥰
I feel like this game constantly hates me. As supp main its hard to climb up in rank mode and I often get paired with dumb players
i love this 😀 game 🎮 my mom played it
Good
The game is very very very super in all like graphics action etc but one problem in 4 gb ram it cannot response in using mobile data it ask the connection of wifi
"Amazing game give me huge nostalgia of those ps2 era when we write cheats on paper or play it in those gaming cafe/small shops around neighbourhood, there are some things which needs fixing like the broken textures, audio issues etc though they aren't game breaking so you can give it a shot specially after the recent update game no longer crash on latest Android devices. (Will update this review as the game gets updated)"
Excellent
Awesomesauce
Mojang why did you fire Rodger badgerman
Maganda
One of the best mobile games I have played and easy to learn
gud
"Literally everyone uses Edgar because they don't know how to play or something, neft that brawler, or simply delete it. Very unbalanced, I just started to use it and wow ... I'm starting to win my games :/"
"Sigh, the ads and7 extra moves have disappeared again please put the ads and the extra moves back in the game. The extra moves and ads in the game have disappeared. These levels are increasingly harder and some of us need the extra moves to level up. Mr King. Please leave the extra moves so we can advance, win a quest, etc Your attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated. Elizabeth"
Fee fii Foo fum I smell old rum
"This is a dishonest attempt to separate you from your money. An honest approach to selling the game would be to offer some number of levels for free. A gamer could then decide whether the game is worthy of purchase and buy it once. As it is, the game play encourages frustration to try and trigger a spending impulse. The open ended game structure is meant to keep a player paying and paying and paying. Stay away from this one."
Bagus😁
"I had this game it is so fun ,but now when I download it again I can't load my account although my account is on my email 😔 please help me"
very disapointing my game is back to tier 2 i almost done the game 😞
"Good port of a meh game Glitch in Starlight Zone Act 2 that crashes the game, I'll send a video if I can find the email address"
Good
"I'd have to disagree & say that this is a pretty lazy port IMO, the control pad set up is lazy, ugly, distracting & has useless buttons aswell as massive blue chunks either side. You're better off download espxe & emulating instead."
Please can u call of duty solve this problem the servers is horrible everytime I enter the game it said timeout
Fun
Continuously getting worse and worse monitization-wise with an overall well made set of bones.
I love this game so much it is attractive and a game everybody should play👍🙂🙂
Awesome
I think this game is really good👍
I love this game. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️‍🔥🧠🫀🩸🦿🦾🤖
"I like this game , ,"

"Fun, exciting game. Always something new."
I love this game is Soper cool
Very nice game
The new controls are weird but the game is still amazing!
"I've had a great time playing this so far on the retroid pocket 3+, no issues except one crash while loading a cut scene. I had wished the free aim actually worked but other than that I have no complaints"
Ok
So gooodddd
"Everything is good, but there is a problem why my account that is connected to the Xbox only loads, but my signal is good"
This is the best game i ever play in my life.......
Great game played since the beginning my only issue is legendary and mythical pokemon should be put into there own league in go battle there op

"It,s the best game that I,ve ever played"
"Es un buen porteo, pero tiene problemas con los controles, Sonic reacciona muy lento"
Very very better Game
Gore very good and detail are nice
A very good game. A mind-blowing game that never gets boring. Please Give us back the theme we had before... the face we had a while ago.And full screen it is very beautiful.
Very good game
You should add more stuff to do in game
It's cool
"Too many ads, mfs couldn't stop at microtransactions"
Good
Honestly why do you guys make a game you can get without adds for free with emulators
"combat fight take no skills , having to walk when there is bad weather makes it impossible to play and there are always the same pokemons appearing"
I can't find out my friend's league. I put the right code but didn't work it
Nice game but eagerly waiting for gta v mobile
Wonderful
Good
Bad update
It's so fun
Good game
"This used to be one of my favorite time killers. I even paid for the ad-free version. But lately it's awful and just not fun. I can't get very far anymore, I don't even know what the new additions are because there's no instructions or tutorial. Stars appear randomly and nothing happens when I click on the total. I don't want to watch ads for extra turns, and the game has begun to feel rigged. Shouldn't have 'fixed' what wasn't broken--it's clearly a poorly thought out money grab."
"terrible mobile experience, entire community is filled with trolls and cheaters. this whole project needs to be shut down"
Very good game 🎮
"Easy and fun, a bit too many adds"
Game is interesting but i opened my new id few days ago....and i see that there is th 15 and i m th 5 and i dont think so that i can complete this games in 10 years...😅😅😅

Awesome game 🔥
Need new attires for new level troops like COC
Good
"It's nice and interesting as well as makes you think, just wish there were easier ways to know what to do to 3star some of the maps."
Kinda LAGGY And also please the celebration of the players
"Way way way to many updates! Very data intensive! 3, 4, 5 gig updates not even a week appart! Ridiculous!!!"
I'm a big fan of Monopoly and love this game version. It's just as much fun as the board game. Thanks!
I used to really like this game I mean I'll even played it to the point that they were sending me little messages saying that apparently I'm in the top 2K by experience but everytime I play infinite venture get past the like level 80 and it just boots me out and it says that I'm cheating and then it would act like I went forward on a couple stages that I haven't even played before then just completely boot me out and then I'll get another message saying that I'm cheating when im not. old gamenow
Awesome 🎮
Been playing for 6 years and update for losers is gonna absolutely kill the game. Sad to have to quit after the changes
Thanks free fire for the memories ❤
Epic
One of the best mobile games I have played and easy to learn

I love 💕😘 it is my life My trend 📉📉📈 i. On it ☺️ you can do it more better than this one I want you to do IT is very good and easy to play good luck for the new update
Now i need to click 3 times to restart...
"Fun game, I got really into it, but the degree of strength on some mecha is ridiculous. Makes it impossible to play. I started when it was very clear cut what each mecha was capable of, and there was strategy involved in which mecha you picked. I played Hotsteel mostly, and I did the best when soaking up damage while pounding the enemy, but fall off hard against long range enemies, and struggle against fast mecha like Arthur. Some of the new mecha are so well done that they can do everything."
The game is good
Too many ads plus the present ads are up in your face
still exploring the game thu. Kinda enjoyable.
Awsome
Cant create account unless you use a chinese number
Nice game
Fun when the power ups actually work. My trash power up hasn't worked for a month. Not sure why.

I love this game is just that there is a issue there anytime I have a pet and u want to play battle royal they will be giving people hard person to face with
Split screen is back and I can invite friends to raids because they resized the split screen view and I can return to raids easier as well.
"Great game, but I have a problem, I couldn't leave the clan or delete my account because "" Connection Timeout "" or whatever it says idrk. Is this a bug? If it is, please fix it. That's why I rate it 3 stars tho."
fun
Please update the game
Extra Mind Blowing game
It's nice game I used to enjoy it when I'm in depression Yesterday I've updated it and it doesn't work at all😒😢😭😩
It is very frustrating to play against someone who pays to win. Apart from that the game is pretty good and can be a lot of fun at times but this just ruins everything good about it.
Waw

Best game .......👍
Funny
Yeah
Nice👍
Love this game! But it is sooo hard to join friends on mobile. I took us 35 minutes at least to join each other.
Crashes mid-game. Constantly losing save data since there's no auto save or save states. FF7 is my favorite game but DO NOT BUT THIS. It's unplayable.
ping normal but not working please 🥺 solove this problem ob39 kai baat
Oh my god I was searching like this creative and building app thanks mojang very much but I changed my mobile it is again asking for money and my rs 670 are wasted

I'm a fan of dragon ball sooo how can't play this game is sooo hype thanks toshi and kai and the others
It's okay
"I just installed this so I can write you, developer's of this game - your advertising in other games is incredibly toxic and intrusive and only makes me hate this game and never want to play it actually."
Port
I really enjoyed playing COD Mobile . takes me back hold days when I was playing COD in the Play Station .. great games !!!
"Excellent graphics, fun to play, and recommend for everyone"
This game is awesome 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
It's amazing tho add a one piece Collab next Month please and give me the awakened but no armour That is all thanks for your time
Wish you would earn legend tokens for the cars you have purchased and trying to restore instead of cars that you are not currently trying to restore/have purchased. They make this game so you have to spend money.
Nice
Been playing for years and still not bored.
The best game I've ever played
خوب
The new controls are weird but the game is still amazing!
When you know that your game can't operate without wifi then should mention it that the user must have wifi connection. Then we would not be downloading it and having it on the phone for no reason. Game is not opening only.
Awesome
It is the worst all of my games crashes and make it arena more easier on mobile this is the worst I would rather play call of duty on mobile
Best game ever! I love you roblox you the best.
It's sometimes happen network error.
👍👍👍👍
The story line is good
Super
Perfect. Only crybaby millennials cry about wanting invincibility. Lmao. Go grind a few levels dingus. This game ain't for whiners.
"Fun and difficult game levels are broken up with quick, easy levels. Graphics are pretty."
Cool
Not bed
Wow just wow 6/28/21 (that's the old me btw) New (edit 3/27/23): i feel some hentai reference this ml version is a phre hentai at heart lol
Good game but please reduce usage of Gcubes or make any event in which we can win Gcubes please🙏🏻
"Fix your god damn map! The one with the train and dessert looking atmosphere is getting on my nerves everytime I'm in that map, if only you could give us a map choice where we can only play the map that we wanted, it's the least you can do since the developer isn't prioritizing the game optimization, glitch, and lag reduce."
"Terrible because of the glitch's, but it's a good game. one star only fix your game"
I love thìs game
"I'm a Chinese. Beening using QQ since 1997. The experience worse and worse year by year. This app at google store is speachless. I have nothing details to complain,but all and every details wrong. Tencet well done!!!!"

It's fine
Sonic x tails Sonic the hedgehog TM classic 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭 I'm so sorry I'm embarrassed so please please I'm so so so so so and there is I'm very very very embarrassed about that I'm so sorry Sonic and tails so please forgive me I didn't mean to do that I just brainstorming so there's 100 or I mean 500 words so I'm just going to say this like 1500 times I'm sorry I'm very very very very sorry about that look how much words I'm saying it makes me too much and I don't know what
This is a very beautiful game
Optional
"The update is good but when you are updateing if pubg give us UC like 2,000 so many people will love pubg more than fortnight please do it it will be cool"
Just another way to play my favorite game! The only baffling thing about to port is the fact that you can't speed the game up.
Mudah dan menyenangkan
"This is the best game now for me... I hope in next update this game has have a multiplayer because it's fun !!!! Ilab, it"
Good

Bruh it awesome please add retro games please and a mini game that will add gold and 2x of it 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
With time it it getting more laggy and slow.
◕⁠‿⁠◕
"Still my favourite game. Is there any possible way to play without using CPUs or bots? I find it frustrating when I am playing with characters who are actually Bots, or fighting and entire battlefield of bots and CPU players."
Nice
It's so fun
"It's a good puzzle game, highly addictive. My only complaint is that I paid for no ads, but, I still need to watch ads to undo a move or rotate a block?"
luv it very challenging at times but good chillaxing time
This is a very fun game
The best clan MƛƊ
Fgg
Nice game
Www
I downloaded it to play Game for peace
🥸🥳
It is very perfect👍
Alot of relaxation
Yo are there ads in Roblox now cuz I JUST GOT A DAMN ADD And btw I ain't playin Roblox ever again my life cuz there are bugs lags gliches in games and I can nearly play a single game cuz it's too laggy and like every single game on Roblox FREEZES
"So i downloaded this game and what i found out, the Graphics are good but the gameplay and controls are just boring, you just have to tap tap screen to fight and it's boring, you can't move freely like to jump/crouch/ move backward/forward it's just tapping the screen. Good game but make the control and gameplay independent"
Best on the VII
"The skin was gorgeous and the gameplaywas so nice, i rated 4 stars because it gets boring also"
👎 👎 👎 👎 👎
I haven't played it best game though
"I like the game and all but it is becoming way too p2w. They nerfed the free side of pass royale and added an extra diamond tier that's even more expensive. And if u buy the diamond tier, u get ARCHER QUEEN NO MATTER WHAT ARENA UR IN!!! Not to mention LEVEL 15 COMING TO THE GAME!!! As a f2p player, this will make it even harder to max out my current deck without spending some money. And u wonder why people quit the game early."
Great so far
Es buen juego cuando le cojes el suin se vuelbe addictive lo juego basicamente diario lo unico q ai q tener paciencia si quieres llegar lejos lo recomiendo
I love this game !!
Great
"Hey, the game is awesome, But one flaw. I playon a chromebook and it's a little hard but thats all graphics are great and the game runs smoothly"
No longer the same.. not accurate in Location.. Not like they used to
Good🔥🔥
Awesome
Good game but So much lagg in this game... and after update getting more lag and also with getting Kick Bug Unable to join any squad...i don't know why MFG didn't take any Step
"Can't install it on my Poco X3 phone. After 100%, it said can't install. It not about line and phone memory. My phone has enough free space and my wifi line are good"
This game is nice
So cool
"I gave 1star, only because of poor matchmaking in game(in championship mode bot like teamamtes come, they don't play or don't use super etc) and some players also cheat in solo mode by teaming up bt no action against them by makers of the game..it seems like makers not interested in solving or improving all these type of negative points"
I am sooooo happy thatbSamsung has this app. Stupid apple banned it.
دوستان خوبم یکی اسم رو بگه با هم بازی کنیم البته من نوبم😂😂😂😁از سیزن ۶ بازی میکنم روم بزار بگامت😏

This game is fully matherchod game
Amazing
"With the removal of Brawl Box, Brawl Stars is now pure effort instead of luck."
I love playing all the games on it!
Very Hard Game For F2p.. But Nice Game
"When you start a game, it automatically pauses."
"Still my favourite game. Is there any possible way to play without using CPUs or bots? I find it frustrating when I am playing with characters who are actually Bots, or fighting and entire battlefield of bots and CPU players."
Best game ever quality better than PlayStation
memory
Pc is better
Man this game is literaly none.it gives Same Player again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again........ The player doesn't get sell.the ai plays like 10 times the player
It takes so long time to consider a winner 😴🥱
شاندار
"I play in low end device. Even though the game lag much and I face many bugs , I still love this game"
this game is very good it gives me a lot of ssr heroes so i rate it 5 stars so good
I love this game l like this game

Great I love bedwars and the way it gets updated so much more than hypixel
Perfect 👌
"This game is just pure cool, with a cute little sonic and friends,He is ready to defeat Eggman!"
I like the game its songs are good but why do u have tocomplete the game just to get tail and sonic 2 dosent. T pls put tails as a playable caracter free
"Only thing i didn't like is the control. Chocobo racing, games involving controls at the game land, basically anything that requires you to control well is nearly impossible to perform well. You will see what i mean. You can forget about getting omnislash in the mobile version because controlling the chocobo is uber frustrating..."
Good work
fun so far
Its good but there's a bug that when i will play and it will jast crash even in loading Please fix it
Good Geme
I like it
I love this game 🎯🎮 🥰
Works better than Vice City. Carl can climb obstacles and hes good with an smg.

"This game is FANTASTIC and also ADDICTIVE! Its levels are very nice! This is a really is a good game because it has cool and different maps, different colours of skin and more. I have been playing it for more than 5 years..... THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS RUNNING GAME!!!! 🤘😀🤘"
Good game

Ap ka dil ni karta hum puri rat piyr kary is a very good friend and I love you so much and I love you so much and I love you so much and I love you so much and I love you mamo so gy hay you will always like the sun when we are away for the night but if we can get together we will be a good enough to stay in a good pub and a nice night to eat a little drink or something for lunch time or a few minutes before we go off to dinner or a pint with the family or a few other friends in the evening and a
Very beautiful
I Can't complete a single battle in this game because this game closes in the middle and I think this game does not want me to play so I stopped playing. Also plus fix auto closing
Best game ever
I loved playing this game especially the mini games until they made it too expensive to play everything that you want to do asks for more and more coins
This game is so opppp!
"I've played this game for years. My record stood at 74,000 for many years! Problem now is the new safety nets they've added to support adverts has made the game too easy. I can always get myself out of trouble. Current score 133,000 and cruising. I liked the brutal structure of only having 1 life. I feel like everyone with a little skill will be banging out 100,000 scores."
Its a very cool gane its good to play when your bored! Its cool time to playy and btw i have been playing this since i was 3yrs old
This Game is best !
"I like it More and More, The rank and legendary Rank are even more exciting and thrilling. Challenged each Match About the hero, i would like the Couple hero to be adjusted, what I mean is Xayah and Rakan. Xayah's 2nd skill can put effects on Rakan's AA but for Rakan the only good for him is his Recall where they can recall together and that's that. I would like to adjust his 3rd skill to increase range(like the pc style) for a better use when they're together in the rift."
💩💩💩💩
I really like this game...it is fun and very enjoyable...helps in passing time....but the only thing I don't like about this game is that the leader doesn't have right to decide a new leader...
It's five stars I'm to lazy to say more
"I works, I can play what I paid"
I LOVE IT
cool
Hate the update you take away weakly poro
It's good I just got a new phone tho downloaded the app it was free . But on my other phone i purchased a couple new boards n a token pack . They haven't given my boards or token pack back can u fix this pls Vintage token bundle Transylvania board n London board pls restore them

"This game is really fun and addicting, however, this game is very intentionally unbalanced because they want you to pay for the game to get the better characters."
This game is v.good I give 5 stars
Ok
Best videogame storyline ever created.
Nice game
best game in the worldddd
The new changes and updates made the game worse. I've played this game for many years and this was disappointing.

Very fun but infuriating and tedious at times
Nice game

Nice
جميلة جداااااا ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good game
"love the game so so much, but recently I've been noticing it crashes a lot more then ever before. not sure if it's my phone or app that is the problem. I have a Motorola Stylus 5G and Cricket is my carrier. usually I can play whatever I want in the game except there will be a race or two that will crash immediately, but now it seems like everything crashes either just after the start or won't even act like it's going 2work. I found 1race that didn't just kick me today. 1 working all others crash"
My. Talking. Tom. Friends
This very good and graphics is fantastic so what your are doing download this game.
"IVE played Computer last4-5 hours and each time computer and dice was predictable!! I can literally be an multi billianaire at Vegas by predicting EVERY single move!! And If Your about to tell me that BS,about the dice algorythm, DO us All an Favor and STOP the Blank LYING to your supporters!!! WORST Monopoly GAME Ever Created!! ONLY decent way to play is Online!! And If no online connection, This Game is SH!#$!!!"
Very good game graphics are superb.
"Not bad, the details and graphics are decent"
Great
"Hate the new tik toc ads, you can't get past them without downloading tik tok or restarting your game. I am quitting playing this game, will not be forced to download an app to keep pkaying. Sad because this was a great game!"
Bloatware chatting app with lots of useless feature.
It is a good good game I would like it a little bit more if it had 2 plear but its bay my ferret company i like hay day but clash of clans is better From Quincy Spick Gorter Burrows
When you know that your game can't operate without wifi then should mention it that the user must have wifi connection. Then we would not be downloading it and having it on the phone for no reason. Game is not opening only.

Please update!!! This app is severely out of date (compared to the version in China). Recently file transfer has completely stopped working! Two star for still being able to send texts.
This game is so 😜
افضل لعبة و لكن اريد ان يكون شجرة الجواهر
Ta fantastica essa
This is good but still not beat sonic mania
"A bit too luck based, make it more so you play a deck and win by skill and not by one single luck based thing. Make it more so you can Max out a deck and play with it so you dont have to max new cars every time when balance changes happen bcz its pay to win. Diamond pass + lvl 15 makes it toooo pay to win. You should atleast make Diamond pass the price of gold and gold half the price of its original due to the release of lvl 15"
It's hard to play but I like to play because of the gameplay
I enjoying this game
Pig
Can you make something new☹️
Great game. Though the updates can be a big cut in your data
"I would love to give this game a 5 star rating but, for the love of all thing's I can not get out of Aeria's house because all cloud wants to do is run!!! I switched up from the analog to the D pad controls but, no such luck!!! I had to of spent a good half hour trying to get the he'll out of that dame room!!! So, I'm stuck!!!! Got the game free with the play pass, so not mad about that. Maybe there is something that could be done to fix this problem?? Or something I might be overlooked???"
🥴🥴
I need help omg the app is glitching and I tried to uninstall and reinstall but it's still the same glitch page.
very good
Falae advertisement saying 100 free summons.
It be nice if I wasn't band from PVP for six hours because the game crashed.
Thank you! for fixing cloud save
Fun
Very bad
Great game if not for the consistent timeout message I get when trying to log into the game and I have come to find out it isn't just me. Please fix
"Guys!do not dowloads this app,it stole u phone information,track ur phone,it gets everything form u phone,u dowload it,and it knows all the privacy information form ur phone!"
"It's a good game but I'm stuck on lowrider mission. The left right, up, down, sequence buttons aren't showing up so I don't know what way to move the haudraulics to win the match."
This is a very wonderful game. Everyone should try this
Nice
hello pubg team if u see this its a great game fun and everything but it takes a Lot Of Space 10.50GB Like thats A LOT pls make it less
It's coooool andi love it
Good
I love this game but pay to get anything is just bad 😞 make me sad
I like the game it plays well but when I get to special stage 3 I start and I get hit in a goal and I can't do any thing its out of my control and there's nothing I can do 😒 why not give us a coin system like in sonic origens
nice game
good
Op
So fun
It's nice I'm enjoying the game lately
Nice game 🎯
Thanks so much for this game
Really good game
"Great game wish the ui were more like final fantasy 9 though, kind of clunky with out a controller on 7"
Loved the game and the quick game for people in a fix! Highly recommend for monopoly lovers!
This is pretty cool and enjoyable and great for sonic fans but the problem is i have to play this game a trash network because if i play this game on any good network for some reason the game crashes so i have to use my trash mobile data to play the game without accessing the leaderboards achievments and i cant login with google play games and the same thing happens with sonic 2 but not sonic cd so pls fix it
After a mtach a player cannot able to cheat with his teammate! But why...?
"The game needs to be updated way too often. If I have a few minutes at somewhere I know is a Pokestop or a gym and I want to catch some Pokemon, I usually end up having to spend that time installing the latest update, instead."
"Bean banned for one day is not right when you did not curse at anyone cuz you can't curse in the game All I said was ""gay?"" Which how is that a curse word they need to update their system It is not 2009 It is 2023 I hope they take the seriously cuz this is going to cause more issues in the future.. since all of this The game is not from anymore they even need to change this or sell it to someone else. OH You also can't say the word discord if that's another way you can contact people"
Classic
Fantastic game!
GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL
not being able to register sucks
I can't catch a pokemon
I have downloaded many games...but this is an awesome game.....i love this game alot🥰🥰...when i'm free i used to play this😁....absolutely super game..😍😉
It's an amazing game it's fun and it's not that hard to get good at
Really fun
This is nice game and design of character and mecha is very good and graphics is very good
Nice
Op
"Like the game of course, but the aggressive ads are ridiculous. Four verifications to end an ad is beyond absurd. You do realize we can emulate this with a rom with way more functionality, right? There is a limit to monetizing old stuff, and this app exceeds that limit"
I dont have g cubes i want 500 g cubes
Great Game. Awesome graphics for mobile
It's nice how ever I can't do 3rd person:(
"UPDATE: Beautifully minimalist UI & gamplay factored heavily into my 5-star review. Re-installed 1010! after a 2-3 year break, played one game, and immediately got rid of it. I'll give it 2-stars for the joy it used to bring :( ORIGINAL REVIEW: Loved tetris growing up. Although this gameplay is different, it's still highly addictive! The awesome thing is the game will always give you pieces you need/ can use; your job is to figure out where. What's your high score?"
This. Is so good game
Rockstar has fixed the game! On Samsung A30s (Android 11) is working
Not bad
My favorite game!
This game is not that much good.. but I better can play mlbb online game.. but still I give 3 start for this game cuz it is kind of boring...
game has no fun without boxes.
A really good game!
I would like to do 5 stars but the game is a bit glitchy somehow when I complete a mission most of the loot I pick up is just gone
This Game is a good I would rate it a 4 star but 5 star if the 1.20 update is good update But Loki Craft is Worst I would rate Loki Craft 1 Star I would play this in 1.20 because it has trim armor it would be so fun in the 1.20 Update Have a good day :).
Very good game I love this and it's so satisfying. I recommend to all of you to play this game .thanks for the wonderful game 🥰
Dainamic game
I enjoying
Love it
Slow nothing much to do
perfect game
Bad game l hate this game 👎 really bad game don't play this game
Very enjoyable and great graphics.
FIX YOUR RECONNECTING SYSTEM TAKE ME 5 MINUTES TO RECONNECT TO THE GAME TO LOSE OMG AND IF I JUST LEFT IT THERE I WOULD JUST GET BAN AND LOSE AMAZING.
"So much paid game ,this game spoilt my expectation and childhood memories"
"I really enjoy playing this game, it helps to pass the time, keeps me really focused, but why am I having to watch ads still if I bought the ads blocker"
"Your game is just called network connection error but my ping was 50,40. and also we need old freedire"
"Good game, but it has a terrible optimization. You're waiting for a long time when you want to return the main screen, next race, or whatever you want."
I want to say that is game is so good but I request to add mic features in this game plzzzzzzzz
Hi I'm a kid I like the game it's really fun thanks for creating game
Cool an Ezy
Fun Online game. Playing with my friends and makng new friends on this game. Super interesting and you learn about the weapons too.
I purchased this game and it won't let me install it. I have more than enough internal memory free and it constantly claims I don't have sufficient space. Google play said I can't get a refund. It's very frustrating!
This game is really good.
I would.give a zero if i could its like a worse version of league its filled with bots and trolls just dont wste your time its only gonna piss you off i unistalled it for good Not punshiment for troll or bots they can ferd and troll and just do it again and again.
Can't have sex with tifa
Takes a lot of space. About 19 GB of space. Other than this it's the best battle royale out there.
"A fun little game to pass some time every once in a while with. My only problem with the game is that I paid for no adds, but the undo and rotate buttons require you to watch an add to use them."
Bad.
Super game in the world is gameplay of fear of being the best game🤘🤙🤘🤙👌👍🤜🤛🤟💕💕💕💖🤝🙏
Good
Full of hackers
I love this game it's alot of fun I can build my own home and make my own friends if any of you all want to be my friend my name in the game is: Alexis 1830. Happy birthday to everyone I hope you have a great day and I wish you many many more ♥️🌌👸
Nice game Have to use brain

"A really great game totally my no.1, but I do have some suggestions, like Dev's should add rapid fire or other modes into ranked mode, cuz then we can have some fun"
Greatest game ever to be launced into the world❤️❤️
خوب
God game
I am a big fan of gta . This one is a very good game .
I can't even open the game today for some reason and it refuses to wanna work. I was just starting to get back into it and this happened so until that changes I'm not changing my review
Takes up entirely too much space on your telephone slowing it down and today wants me to update with a huge file. This game isn't worth it so UNINSTALLED
I thought this was a offline game.
This game is chutiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .

Fun game you can choose your new weapon attire often
"Fun game that constantly evolves with new difficulties the higher you go on the game map. Keeps things new and exciting. Play it, you'll like it."
Good game
Game is very good but on Android playing game crash problem face many time please fix my phone Android 13 6gb ram but why game crash .
😍😍😍😍😍😍😛😛😚😚
Beautiful
Google pls pay attention to this game they are banning players for saying hi and youtube YouTube is your child this game must me banned
I may be cynical but it really does feel like you need to pay to win after a while or maybe I'm just unlucky
"Was fun, now not so much. More of a money grab these days."
This is a good game but i want to trade legendary finished so pls can you add that and your legendary finished need to be level 5.000 or ultra

Great 😃👍
"Sigh, the ads and7 extra moves have disappeared again please put the ads and the extra moves back in the game. The extra moves and ads in the game have disappeared. These levels are increasingly harder and some of us need the extra moves to level up. Mr King. Please leave the extra moves so we can advance, win a quest, etc Your attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated. Elizabeth"
"Riot!! Plz fix your game! After recent update, it has been constantly crash mid game and during in loading screen before the match started! I been getting punished for afk because of this problem!

Www
Vary god game
Ads are important. Why there is no ads
No words to say 🤩
Amazing
I love this ge
This game is full of bugs in every update we have to face new bug.
Op
Great game
One of the most worst football games. I would rate it -5. Because VSA never ends. And I would have scored more goals and it says time up to me and gives 10 secs more to the opponent and he would tie
Its an alright game. Base game doesnt include much and dlc is way overpriced
This game is really good but sometimes the connection gets lost in a vital battle anyway this game is excellent❤
Beautiful game
Good to kill
Love it it brings out the creative in me
The graphics are brilliant best racing mobile game ever
Nice
"Obviously the game itself is amazing, but this is not a good experience. Lots of unexpected closes, lots of lost data. If you want to play on your phone use epsxe where you get save states and fast forward"
Nice game and I love you
Port
I like playing this game
BUGGY! The blocks are not responding well when I move them. I had to clear cache everytime but to no avail. Please fix this
This game so much good but one problem this game not owner tow account
dear free fire team map mein not third party application apps but my account suspend but why I know understand my emotion this free fire but why suspend my account please recovery my free fire account please
Very low than Asphalt 8
The game is very good but i think you need to add a report button because there is too much team up in solo
GOOD GAME
"Addictive, Enjoyable, Love It Baby... Shouldn't make a sista start all over from level one ... Once you got the thirty mark, the forty mark, etc., etc."
Great
Worst game

This app is very long time for download
Very nice game i love it
There was no doubt about it that this was my favorite game when I was growing up the only thing is I wish the cloud save would work because I keep changing devices and since I do that I keep having to restart the game but still going to give 5 Stars though
Full on timepass
A good game of db good animation good fights all good but the summons are broken
Great game but I am facing netwirk connection issue although my internet is stable and at good speed but it stops the game even in matches plz fix that. Thankyou!
Good game and pls give diamond scorpion pls want it because i love it
Superb
"Not enough storage space error, I have a memory card this is another error...smh can't even enjoy this game always something"
This is one of my happy places. The perfect game to organize my thoughts with.
Good
it's a game were you get power ups
The best game I've seen in a while also my most favorite dbz game!!!

I like it very much there is one small issue can u remove fuel tanks please 🥺
"Played first level, tried to collect rewards, couldn't. According to game I am not connected to internet, I have network error 7. Apart from that, can't even comment on game"
"Loved this game when it first came out, works best when you Bluetooth your ps4 controller to your android device, I use an Xperia all really simple, plays really well, five stars from me 😊"
Fun but your character choice is limited. There's three characters that are for sale and you have a time limit on those to buy them or not. You can't just by Jason Voorhees for example. You have to wait until they put him on the character list for sale currently.. so yeah that kinda sucks. But rather than that. Ok🤷‍♂️👍
This is the best Game ever
Still Fun!
So many many many bugs.....
Game is great but there is a bug. I watch ad and after that shows like I didn't fo anything and can watch it again and still don't get gain bonus 50% xp
😂😂😂😂

I like roblox this so amazing game
They screwed everything up by adding ads. Game is almost unplayable at this point.
Can this game play with 4gb
"Ever since the last update, the app keeps crashing every few minutes. Fix it."
"We will see if it is worth a 5 star or not. To be continued. Starts out fun turns into a job, not worth it. IGN can't even pair kingdoms to fight that are even close in might or abilities."
ΑΧΡΙΣΤΟ ΔΕΝ ΣΕ ΑΦΗΝΕΙ ΝΑ ΠΕΖΕΙΣ ΜΕ ΦΙΛΟΥΣ ΤΑ ΑΛΛΑ ΟΜΩΣ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΚΑΛΑ ΘΑ ΒΑΛΩ 2 ΑΣΤΕΡΑΚΙΑ
This app is my favourite app is so interesting 100+ gamas i like this app
very good
"The concept of the game is awesome. Thank you for inventing it! In the improvement later on, your game is only getting worse. As a fellow game designer I hope this feedback will help you: - Advancing mainly add hp and dmg(by items, levels...), creating an artificial (P2W) bar stopping advancement - The strongest powerup are the starter ones, so your chances get weaker as you advance. Edit: Sent an email months ago. Got no answer. Reducing a star"
I like this game
😈😤
Super good i nearly played it for 2 hours
terrible game.. stupid developer.
Do try this App there's Sonic error Do download this Sonic 1 on the app

Very good stuff child hood memories
If you don't play for a while it's best to reinstall as you'll be stuck with multiple updates back to back
Decently good
Free fire is better than local Warfare
"Is gonna, Get different"
Most fun shooting game I ever played on Android. I like the haptic feedback when u fire a weapon.
Cool man
good
I've been playing this game for 7-8 years and its just as fun now as it was when I first started. I have bad anxiety and this game always helps calm me down while boosting my mood 😊.
Very good game 👍
The game is a amazing port to mobile
Op
I love clash it's a great game I've played it for about 4.7 years now I play every day or pretty close to it its like chess 2.0 some people think it's about placing things down fast but it's about placement and timing and tactics
This game is so good and the graphics look really smooth - Keep it up Epic!
👍
I am speaking from Bangladesh. I am trying hard to open the account but I can't open the account.

Is good
Thz in
With time it it getting more laggy and slow.
"For some reason when i download it it gets up to 100% and it just restarts, it doesent download"
"It's a very fun and strategical game and as long as you have more than 2 brain cells you will easily be able to overpower stronger opponents who are significantly higher level. If you see any of those 1 star reviews that say the game is too hard and pay to win just ignore them, the people who wrote them suffer from a medical condition called ""skill issue""."
"After spending too much money on the game, they decided to suspend my account claiming that there was a violation of the terms of use(cheating) knowing that my account is new. Knowing that I do not have any high fusion cards and I could not even finish the last tower WLT so how could I be cheating?"
"Well worth the money spent, great way to pass time"
Good
Fun
Unable to install after every update. Please check this glitch
Graphics are spot on
This game is too realistic

Worst game
Once I go to open the game it says that it needs an update but when i go to install the update on google play it doesn't show the update button.
Can't register need help !?
"After every game there's an ad, and it comes on the screen so fast its like being hit. It turns into a race to see how fast you can hit the back button so you don't have to look at the ad. The games not bad, otherwise. EDIT: and now they put up a stupid sad face if you lose and try to get you to pay to continue the game"

Great game great for beginners considering how old the game is but it's very time consuming
"Yo, am super excited this proofs that the norrplay team really deal with problems when laid, well i had promised to review this and give a 5star rating if they could fix the problem i had and to my suprise it was fixed, kudos to you guys keep it up"
Clasic 👌
Very unbalanced in the last update Everyone deals so much damage Tanks are just useless now
Wow
Brilliant game
Nice game
Idk what to say..
"Loading in is nearly impossible half the time, after the new update that was meant to stop VPNs, after that it has been nearly impossible to log in consistently."
good game
i like minecraft because technoblade
Sonic 1 Is Overrated 🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔
Pathetic game interface
JUST GIVE ME MY ROLEEEE WHY IS IT SO HARDDD
Classic nostalgic feel. However it's just a cash grab and super cells very greedy.
"Way boring game, items are small, the game have so many confusing details and differs from the (misleading and annoying) ads. Therefore, I don't really want to learn the game because it's just boring Uninstall"
I don't know what to say it's amazing even though it needs 544 mili bytes and I've clear 4 gigabytes and no redownload.
It too pay to win but amazing game Loved the units my favorite is ssb goku revival ui
Needs some fixing on matchmaking and it also takes so long I waited over 6min still nothing
dl Minecraft add-on
Very nice game but bedwars hacker Ban

Paid to remove ads. Game still makes you watch an ad for rotating or undoing.
6 months

Every time data conations error
2v2 now takes forever to load. 2v2 is the best part of the game and they made it worse. I'll give this a couple more days and then uninstall
Good game.🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌

Your server is so poor for some time Every day I am not able to login the game ethier my network is strong eles where the game is very good I loved it and enjoy playing
I love this game
"Okay. This game is the most competitive game racing game. Asphalt 9 legends are a whole different level of racing. Unlike Asphalt 8, which hasn't got police chases, this one has. I fully recommend this game, but please the advertisements is annoying"
Helps my stress
Best game 😎😎
I like how there are mutiple mode to play but I don't like how they did not make the illusioner an egg and you have to summon it
I'm addicted to this game it's a must play if you enjoy a rush of adrenaline when you play games
op plz give me gems bro
Please fix the match making issue where I met the top tier players while I am like rookie or something
Great game if not for the consistent timeout message I get when trying to log into the game and I have come to find out it isn't just me. Please fix
The only stars I can give and get
"The games awesome like well done,its also different and its like anime but, I keep on encountering hackers every ""ACE TIME"" which is really unfair!"
"Ok I had to rate 5 stars again since we can now change our lobby audio theme with a few old seasons audio theme, hope more of them will be added, like the og season 1 original soundtrack and the one from Going Dark, amazing feature, thanks CODM, this was definitely one of the things I wanted the most in the game. 🙌"
I like the game but theres one problem everytime I play the game for a certain amount of time the game closes me out instantly but it's not a bad game just fix that then it will be great 😃 it happens every time I play for 5 minutes the good part is I still have all my progress so I can just go back into the game when it closes out. But sometimes after it closes out and I press on the game it loads for a second then I closes out so I dont know why it does that but it's still not a bad game.
Very very super
Imagine copy Roblox worst game ever 🤢🤢🤢🤢
i want to install but i cant install why
Touch buttons don't work at all
The are hard
There's so many problems trying to open and play the game. I already knew they sexualize some Pokémon. But in order to get credit for playing with Pokémon you have to rub it sexually. I think that's called grooming. I will probably be punished for writing this. They will make game harder to play and will have a harder time catching and getting shinys
Need new attires for new level troops like COC
GG
Takes a lot of space. About 19 GB of space. Other than this it's the best battle royale out there.
I need get v badge

I rly love the game but the thing is I have every rare and super rare brawler but now the chances of me getting a brawler are less than 1% that's terrible pls help me supercell I rly want new brawlers but it's way too hard to get a brawler. Let me tell u how hard it is. So I got the brawl pass season 12 and I'm on like lvl 65 and I still got no brawlers from it pls I'm begging I super cell help me. Thank you.

"OK, I love this game but I gotta say, the Adventure sync needs work. It will just drop out whenever it feels like it and I've wasted about 3 poffins because of it. It's crazy how I can literally go run a mile, and come back to see the adventure sync say I've walked 0.02 km. As someone who can't play regularly adventure sync really helps me save some time, so please check it out"

"The new production team is rubbish. Only know how to increase the prices. Events are useless.To get like 1 incubator/normal ""blue"" kit need to play 120 - 600min. Incubator only shows the blueprints if you not top uped.(I spin 60 -80 incubator vouchers but not even got a single blueprint) *Game getting harder for mobile players and they forcing to mobile players to play with emulator players. Help team also just faking. They don't even read the message. Just send pre created messages."
Game is great.
The best app ever in the world I love this game is so good 👍 plus I love sonic games
Badest game ever

"It's good, but needs a few changes. 1. How about double-player for 9 and up? That would be cool. 2. Stop being as greedy as mr krabs please."
Updating my review. Always been my favorite game to play. Keeps me busy and doesn't get old. They have fixed all the crashes that used to happen and have even the updated the game to make it even better!
Give me 50 dollars 🗿 please 💔
Nice

"I love this game but I hate the New Stone Block. It is unbreakbale which destroys the point of blocks. It makes it to where if you are playing Duels, instead of people fighting to progress the game, they hide and get easy wins. It is the most shallow thing and the game would be better if it was taken out."
It is good K I love dragon ball Legends pickles super Saiyan Broly and super Saiyan God Goku and Vegeta And I have super Saiyan super Saiyan Goku I have Goku and I have super Saiyan gogeta Dragon Ball Legends address for you and God for you L
Amazing weapons! 🤨
"This game is FANTASTIC and also ADDICTIVE! Its levels are very nice! This is a really is a good game because it has cool and different maps, different colours of skin and more. I have been playing it for more than 5 years..... THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS RUNNING GAME!!!! 🤘😀🤘"

Awesome game!
Pubg gift UC please

Even though I never tried it I'm probably going to download it on time though it's so good though someone really really likes it and it's not my brother really likes it so I'm going to give you five stuff goodbye
It is an osome game
This us a very fun game
Great!!!
Beautiful game
Alot like the PS2 classic.
This app is the best 👌 all my friends are talking about it
Am giving 4 because every time opponent will get troop faster than me
"Great to be able to play this classic on my phone, however there is one issue. The virtual controls are not aligned properly (on my device at least). Where you see the buttons, the actual spot to press is a little to the left. Changing the layout does not help and can actually make things more difficult to play, increasing the the space between the shown buttons and where the input area actually is."
very good
Amazing..
Its a great that I play and I enjoy it
very good game it is
Sucks on the switch put better fps
I love the games so much
Why would you make the distance so small? Ridiculous. Cant reach any pokestops/gyms anymore. Fix it Niantic!!
"Back in 2016 this used to be an excellent time waster. I understand the need for revenue, but the means by which Zynga generates said revenue has and always will be atrocious since they are fans of long, constant motion ads interrupting/ distracting from gameplay. Buying ad-free requires your actual card, you cannot use your Play Wallet (asinine). The special effects are equally distracting and the game was perfect before they started the power-up nonsense. DONT BOTHER, ITS ZYNGA."
Nice game I like it very much
Your game is not opening in my phone
You might add something as a mini game like night base in coc
Awesome
I am sooooo happy thatbSamsung has this app. Stupid apple banned it.
Nice game
Best game ever
Love the game...so interesting and calming 😊
It wus amazing
Hungry for ad....very poor gaming
Great strategic game!
让我登陆验证，明明只给我一个选项 - QQ扫描验证，但是还阴阳怪气写“请选择以下任一种方式验证”。你TM只给了一个选项，哪来的以下任一种方式？？？扫描验证是这样的：“1.拿出原来使用的手机，确保该手机已登陆qq号; 2.打开手机qq扫描二维码。”你自己看看你说的是人话吗？？你猜我为什么用这个手机登陆？？我有以前的手机我为什么要用这个手机登？？？？被迫提供了这么多的PERSONAL INFO，都有我手机号了，就不能手机验证吗？？？我震惊了，什么垃圾玩意儿
Great game enjoying the classic and the new editions
This is so amazing
Currently stuck on level 305. They give you 15 moves and over 200 things to beat to complete the level it just dont make sense to me. Seems like every other board I need to purchase more things in order to complete level which is trash!
I love this game
I can't log into my account
"I would love to give this game a 5 star rating but, for the love of all thing's I can not get out of Aeria's house because all cloud wants to do is run!!! I switched up from the analog to the D pad controls but, no such luck!!! I had to of spent a good half hour trying to get the he'll out of that dame room!!! So, I'm stuck!!!! Got the game free with the play pass, so not mad about that. Maybe there is something that could be done to fix this problem?? Or something I might be overlooked???"
I wish there was seseon 1 the of Map

Bad game. Stiff controls... They don't allow us to use 3/4 fingers and they don't allow us to switch the controls to our liking.

Easy relaxing passes time
"I like this game. I love the additions of new heroes, that are only unique to ML Adventure, though i hope they'd be added to MLBB in the future. The game's pretty free to play, and it's fun to summon all kinds of heroes, and it's very easy to farm for a 10 pull. Unlike some games, ML Adventure has this dynamic of getting an SSR by completing each cambaign stage, after you get a bit further into it. Very fun, very simple. 10/10."
"When I earn 500+/1000 coins every time match the total coins shows only 400/500. Why is this happening? I should have 35000+ coins, but showing only 2000. Even every time I enter the game it shows different coins, like 1000 one time, 500 the next time, 800 the next time! Why?? Because of this I can't even buy the features I want."
"Latest update is removing info, not adding...can not play game....highly disappointed."

Instead of correcting the mistake, ingame Customer Support after being provided with screenshots and videos, being unable to correct the mistake, they cut off access to CS ticketing system.

Best racing game you are even going to get on phones but devloper need to give more playing time not ads 😊
"Am using a Huawei ever since this game was launched and now I cant play anymore, because of this Unknown problem -13, and because the wasn't install using google play (which isn't available on huawei device (even using gbox and gspace to install the game.)) It's just sucks that I can't play it anymore."
"Loved this game, keep improving! 👍🏻"
Nice game
This game is great
The best in the series alongside 10
"The game was great at first. It was only half pay-to-win, and really great. But, since the update with no more boxes, now you can just buy as many tokens as u want and get literally any brawler. I give this 3 stars only for the fact that once was a good game."
Awesome game having fun
Sonic > Mario 🗿🤝😎
It won't even let me play it always is telling me that archero is running too slow
It is such a fun game it reminds me of destiny which is also a rilly fun game but the game could have better graphics tho.

This version is 'too' old. Ps : According from Tencent CSR
On
This game Made Me Have Ptsd I Hate It
"The game suddenly needs an ""Age Verification"" ""to help us follow regional age regulations"" before being able to play it. This is clearly just a cover to obtain basic data for advertisers. What other reason can there be for knowing whether I'm ""18-34"", ""35-49"", or ""50+""? If this rubbish isn't removed from the app then I'm uninstalling it."
It is okay some games have hackers and exploiters

"This game is not good, in others mobile it is very realastic in mine very blury Lika a pixel game i was very sad my 2 GB Also over why to me 😞 also very lag when i race"
❤️❤️
"Can't even play normal games because of honour score If my internet goes off, this game will not even let me play Always honour score is less"
Good 👍😊
This game is good but i need uc for free
"Wrost game i had ever seen in my life, playing from 8 hours, lossing every matches continuously, in ranked mp, the most wrost game ever seen. 😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
Exciting!

Pay to win 🥲
Wonderful game
good
"Updated review: Game is shi,bad quality updates,all about the money,pay to win,bad buffs. I legit hope this game doesn't make even one cent anymore."
A classic on the go
"@Supercell, the new update ""update for losers"" seem to have triggered a lot of players. It's much more complicated now for non-competitive casual players. Like many, I am not really a fan of many things in the update - an update for me to delete and stop playing the game."
The app works pretty well with the exception of allowing you to switch to another app and switch back really quick. If you start an online game you need to stay on the app until the game finishes or it will likely crash. Everything is great though
Ok I never thought that CALL OF DUTY COULD BE ON MOBLIE I REALLY DO LOVE THIS GAME EVERY NEW DEVICE I GET THE FIRST THING I DOWNLOAD
this is a terrific dustbin nothing else... you have money buy players win matches. there is nothing fare in this game...this is to ea sports 🖕🖕🖕
The game is rigged. At first it lets you win a lot... So you get excited and the more you play the less you win. So you get kind of addicted and want to keep playing till you win again or to pay extra money for other games. So stay away.
The new controls are weird but the game is still amazing!
It is the wors game i played it have too many glitches and you must lose so many times because of this bad systems that don't help player's
Fortnite is trash
This game was better......but now it's become trash 🗑️
شكراً جزيلاً لكم
This game is Amazing ❤ A great game so far. It will be better if we can select the map.
"It's a good game but I'm stuck on lowrider mission. The left right, up, down, sequence buttons aren't showing up so I don't know what way to move the haudraulics to win the match."
"Mediocre. Game could be very good but developers rigged the game. Shapes are not close to random, in fact quite the opposite. Based on your board, you can predict which unusable shapes you get next. Playing this game is like expecting neutrality at carnival games."
Good
"always down server and trash game play tower like play cheat pro player 🐖💨💨💨 always not recommended purchase any, too expensive and not worth it"
the greatest game ever made !!!!!
I cried myself to sleep because of this horid game
Hi Roblox uh someone is going into my acc/account can you fix this? Thank you

Best monopoly game
Love this game..only hates the ads..please make it go away
SO FUN I really like it and I killed him a LOT
"Pretty fun, nice to play when I have nothing to do, like on a train or bus journey"
The ad is a lie. Fake game. It only shows the mini games which is only a tiny fraction of the game. Don't fall for it.
Pay to win game
boring game with copies from other games
Daddy Daan
"Despite your game recently including the HP Overflow as a useful ability the wheel that spins after taking damage and defeating a boss still sometimes gives you extra health when you do not need it nor can you use it. This is useless, pointless, and frustrating as a gameplay mechanic. Please make an improvement to this."
Very great
I like this game but it takes to time
"very fun/addicting game to play while watching youtube for example, even bought the ad free version and a theme, its just very annoying that it doesnt work with split screen anymore also i wish i had the option to hide those weird power up things, i dont care about those and they just ruin the clean aesthetic :( would be 5/5 otherwise edit: i just noticed that powerups are still locked behind ads even tho i paid for no ads!? what?"
Mast
IF YOU WANT WASTE YOUR TIME FEEL FREE AND INSTALL THIS TRASH GAME
I am completely stuck on level 57 as there is not enough moves to complete the level. At this point I have tired 50 time and I still can't do it. What should I do?
Watching a player win 20 times more often than me just shows that deposit money in this game and you will be cheated by the game devs
Worst app if the year. Seriously just remove the app and get a better ui designer and stuff. Obviously penguin doesn't know what human likes and want. 0 star.
I love this game I'm playing it from 4th anniversary it's the best game of dragon balls I have played on Android
"Super fun game, no ads, And you can play offline. Definitely recommend."
Why i can't install blockman go now?
I love the game
Easy way to pass time
Nice 👍
dl Minecraft add-on

Classic game
Very cool game i love it
"Good game Graphic is good, good attitude good approach personally I like it"
"Can't use the app because it isn't updated to the ""latest version"" so they want you to go to their website and download an apk..... Yeah no. SHADY."
As always a waste of time
Great but please dont mke the updates compulsory.
"Menu is slow and have bugs, but when the game load it runs perfeclty on my old chromebook (Pixelbook go, intel i5-8th, 8ram). Also it has keyboard and mouse optimization. Overall i am happy with this new minecraft version for chromeOS."
I would like to do 5 stars but the game is a bit glitchy somehow when I complete a mission most of the loot I pick up is just gone
It's an amazing game
Nice game but no boat or jetski or airplaine or Helicopter or jets
Best drag race game!!
Nostalgia train.
"Classic that runs smooth I'd be cool if it had a fast forward like they did with 9 but even without it, it's fun and stimulating."
OG GAME
i like this game😇😇
Lit
It kept asking for the identification. No matter how much and how many times I entered my ID (I will never forget). It really wasted my time.
Then it used to be my favorite.but now it's full of bags and it keeps on logging out.it sucks.please fix that otherwise...
I like how o can just take my anger put on this ragdoll its a good stress reliever
"The game at lower levels is luring and habit forming. At higher levels, no matter how many chests you open, the algorithm will not let you upgrade any card to level 10 or above at least not the cards that matter unless you purchase something from the clash royale shop. It draws unbalanced game for you to finally make a purchase for good cards. Fraudulent by design. They think people won't understand their trickery."
Hi i Need Help Phone Me Poco X4 Pro New Updite Crash To Island Why? please Game Fixe Crash😰🤕🤕
10 out of 10 this is to good but they have to make skins cheaper
Worst experience ever. After new update it is not opening at all and 'wifi error' message poping out and although I have connected to wifi network the game data is not downloading and it makes the phone run slow(although I use a snapdragon 870) that if you want to close the game it is not closing and display touch sensor also not working.Fix this soon enough and update it.
Was cool but within the past 30 days it has been a HASSEL!!! Hard time logging in
This app is the best 👌 all my friends are talking about it
This game worth to play
Good
"I absolutely love this game. Mechanics and battling take a little getting used to, but honestly, it's an amazing game."
I wanna try vanguard guns

Kkk
"I love the actual game but they can't control the advertisments they show, I got a weird ad saying I won a Aldi voucher that was obviously a scam."
this game is very neic iam liked super game
Greatly enjoyed
I Love the Game
Awesome and fun game
It's Allright
Why playstore devlopers didn't say about this app recently. Because this app isn't real. Besides there is a new version of this app. Why playstore didn't release update ver. of this app?
It's been updated and it's works like a charm ✨️
Guys... why??? ...ok so I get you're trying to make some cash from what was a free game... so if your aim is to get people to watch videos... for goodness sake get rid of the countdown delay... its a complete waste of time and serves ONLY to delay people playing or delete game through pointless delay... Please get rid of countdown!

Why the hell did u delete 2v2 are u crazy???
"Being able to play, not only the best game ever made, my favorite game ever - the game that changed my life - the greatest interactive story ever told; on my mobile device, is such a treat. All things considered, the app looks great, plays great, and there is zero to little lag, not to mention the decent frame rate. My only wish was that there was the ""invincibility"" mode and high speed mode that was introduced in the PS4 port. Other than that, I have nothing but praise for this classic piece!!!"
My problem is sinh in Why
al good the best
Great game!!!!! but in Skyblock people scam me and take things which i buy from real money!
Good
Love the app! Would be better if we could record wins

"Absolutely fantastic blast from my youth 😊 love playing it as it is the original although digitally remastered, but only for the better 😉"
For some reason my game just stops working. I'll be in the middle of a level and the game just stops. It's really driving me nuts. Please fix it

I like Minecraft it's a better game! Hard work on this game
"Loved this game, had it for years BUT only lately have I realized that it's rigged. I'm often given pieces that can't fit so I can never improve my high score. The ads are really long and now it's not worth it"
Gets pay to win after a while.
One of the best game but I just thought it would be an idea to add some stray people who rome around the hub and can provide with some special things that no one else can give as they are stray the quantity should be less thank you for reading one of the best game
"this new update is absolute trash. y'all have ruined 2v2 matches with the new retarded estimated wait time's, level caps and removing the ""play again"" button, fix your damn game supercell."
I got this game via Play pass lucky but I think it's not worth buying otherwise
One of the best games
😻😻😻 gorgeous...👻👻 wanderfull gemes
"Hello, E sports and Fifa developer people please refine your servers, it's a lot more boring to play the even though the game is too good to play but due to the issues of connecting to server and loading symbol for almost around 20 seconds occuring even under 300MBPS speed data I'm not feelinhlg to play the game. Also if the problem exists more i will uninstall the game"
"Wow! I love me some good ol' Clash Royale. The boys and I always be clashing on some good ol' Clash Royale. Back when I was a pro clasher, I loved Clash Royale. Clashing on Clash Royale always makes my day! Gee wiz, this game is surely a great game. If I could recommend someone to Clash on some good ol' Clash Royale, I would certainly recommend some fun ol' clashing on Clash Royale!! I love Zaza!"

Uhm can you optimize it for low end device I think you guys are forgetting about us who play in low end device I play this game btw I'm a old player but I quit because its become lagging because of the new ui but its cool ui i just want you guys optimize it for low end device and put low graphics because medium is not enough so thank you for understanding So yeah I hope you can understand because I only have 5 fps. Edit:thank you Moonton company I hope you guys can optimize it keep it up❤❤
Normal match making is really bad. Get super lop sided lobbies where I will be grouped with 3-4 iron players and the other team will have 1 iron and 3-4 plat+ players. Super fun riot. Thanks.
"Used to be fun, but suffers from stretching itself too thin. It's engaging with a lot of side gamemodes, but they're always trying to add more modes, characters, new leveling systems, etc. Unfortunately a lot of those gamemodes have some sort of stability/lag or balance issue. Devs seldom listen to the community when it comes to balance issues, or minor glitches that do not affect their income stream. Update: Increased review up to 3 stars from 2, as the recent update has much faster menus."
"IT'S SO BAD, MAKES ME RAGE, SO STUPID, NOT FUN AT ALL NEVER PLAY MAKES U RAGE"
This is a very good game because if you donowed it you can play any sand box game in free
This game is incredible it's like a game in in thousands of games
Sunitha
Stop freaking updating every single week damn
Best game
Very very bad app . Not working this app
Best game ever
"I like the game and all but it is becoming way too p2w. They nerfed the free side of pass royale and added an extra diamond tier that's even more expensive. And if u buy the diamond tier, u get ARCHER QUEEN NO MATTER WHAT ARENA UR IN!!! Not to mention LEVEL 15 COMING TO THE GAME!!! As a f2p player, this will make it even harder to max out my current deck without spending some money. And u wonder why people quit the game early."
the game is good can't even sleep at night busy playing 😂😂😂
I love 💕😘 it is my life My trend 📉📉📈 i. On it ☺️ you can do it more better than this one I want you to do IT is very good and easy to play good luck for the new update
I like it so much because i win all th time
I love Monopoly... Especially the Monstropolis. It's fun and has great sounds and entertaining property names!!! Edited to say if the game freezes....restart your phone. If it still doesn't work restart again. It WILL work!!! :)
Very engaging and entertaining.
Op
I Can't complete a single battle in this game because this game closes in the middle and I think this game does not want me to play so I stopped playing. Also plus fix auto closing
"I love this game and the graphics etc, but ive been crashing for no reason im using a Galaxy A13, All the graphics are low and im still crashing how do i fix this."
I think this is a good game
Unhappy summoner here.

Paid to remove ads and yet everytime I want to rotate a block there are still ads. It's a scam.
Experience is good. Please join bike racing mode in game😍

"Beautiful, Exciting and Engaging. CSR 2 has it all, and it doesn't hesitate to prove it! The graphics and art style are top notch, and the customization is so satisfying too! The story keeps the campaign interesting, but it isn't anything too extreme. A solid 9/10 and recommended for all racing fans! Shy out of 1 point due to the very chunky data usage and overheating of even the best phones... don't play if you have a weak phone..."
"I've loved the game since I started playing in early 2020, but recently, I've realised that the game has issues with storage. I've kept it on my SD card, but the latest update placed the 20g+ game onto my phones storage and won't allow me to move it back. Edit the problem still isn't fixed"
So had
Cool
"Remember your game Clumsy Ninja? Fix it please, when we go back to the game. It is deleted"
"Updated in July, fixing cloud saves. A classic game and a decent port."
The best game
"The update is good but when you are updateing if pubg give us UC like 2,000 so many people will love pubg more than fortnight please do it it will be cool"
Why i cant login ??
🥴🥴
It's fine just very laggy and my friend can't invite me even though there account is connected
"When using the power up options that require you to watch ads, there are several times when you can't exit out of the ad at the end. You restart the app only to find that the previous ad viewing doesn't count, you're subjected to the same ad again, and on and on it goes."
Not as much fun as it used to be...

Not bad. 100% needs new stuff adding to it. Hi thanks for commenting back. Ye there's loads of stuff you can do. New missions instead they repeat themself no matter how many time you do it never get new ones. Different guns I.e more new guns added. Different maps. Spent money on this game but no longer keeps me entertained as it's just the same old stuff. Also why do you lose fame after so long not playing it don't think that's right as takes alot of effort to get your fame up. Thanks
Ye brought me here
roblox why did you ban me for 1day😔😔☠☠☠☠☠💀💀💀

"Same problem!!! Still network issues!! Lag and hitting issues 20% less! Date: Mar 22, 2023"
The games full of bugs now and lags a lot. While playing hero party the game becomes slow. My hero's weapon speed also becomes slow. In hero duo mode enemies comes near hero out of nowhere. This game sucks after last update
Baieti daca nu va place acest joc sunteti prosti si nu stiti sa va jucati eu sun arena 10 si 4 legendare fara sa cupar nimic

"I grew up playing Final Fantasy. FF7 was the entry that got me started in the franchise, so this is extremely nostalgic for me. The android version stays true to the original playstation version, except for one or two added optional features."

First game I won I love monopoly
"Is gonna, Get different"
"Please fix this bug, in the blockman go app it says the game has more than 0 players but when I join the game it has 0 players but in the app it says like 50 players so pleaseeeee fix this it happens in games like The exorcists etc."
Garbage
This game is a scam it is unfair they even wrote it's offline I hate this game noeone should buy it never ever 1star rate so it can post
Nice
"My wish if natural motion add some gold keys in weekly Elite cup, Because getting gold keys is very very hard, impossible I love this game Nice graphics ✋👋 keep it up developers Valentine's day, Christmas, Halloween etc events should be added if possible.... Otherwise over all fantastic game 👌👍🙋🏻"
"Its a good game but when playing mulitplayer once the human player leaves and the bots take over, they make stupid trades giving out streets for almost free to the others. There should be a time penalty of not being allowed to play given to the players that leave. Also a ranked system with obtaining points for winning and a ladder system would incentive players to keep playing."
So far so good~ u like mecha anime? This is the game u are searching for..... Or curse like other games u need to read what does do any weapon plus is brand new all weapons are different and powerful no matter what weapon u use is OP it depends on how u used and whats ur fav. Update fron 2019 to 2023 game died like in season 3 🤣 its barely alive but only in the Chinese server
Cool app
Life simulator
Okay
Okay
The game good
calm game
Love this app I used this to vent.
Boht fazol game ha
Wowo nice game childrins
I think you need to fucos on upgradeng of the game and the Mecha not on the skin of the characters and I think you need to ban all players that use cheats and hacks and I think you need to give a aurora 2k shield just like the others mecha And if that's happened I will grow up my 1star tl 5 Star
I love such games when we can control them. Would you mind making more game like this but of cooking....etc
I love the game
💀🥶🥶
Ecxelente juego👍😁
Very bad experience
One of the best games i ever played
Brilliant game.i love it.thank you
"So many adventures to choose to play,yes it is good game,but for the ""akashic ruin"",it's difficult to reach to last level,I hope there's also a guide like the other level,I'm very upset.Please help me"
Good but need the choice to watch vids more often.
Slow
Nice but I want more control setting like joystick or Analog mod
Takes a lot of space. About 19 GB of space. Other than this it's the best battle royale out there.

"The game is really good and all but is there some kind of bug in chapter 3? the mobs stopped spawning in early floors and i can't leave chapter 3, also the loadings are quite annoying it's taking a year"
Literally one of my top 3 favorite games ever made
Exelente
"I love this game and the graphics etc, but ive been crashing for no reason im using a Galaxy A13, All the graphics are low and im still crashing how do i fix this."
What is the reason for I give 1star the game was no optimize because when i play shodown and when the last enemy stands and i almost kill him the game was crash i know i have low end device mobile but you have to optimize the game for better experience
Pokemon company just add more mega pokemon for eg mega Rayquaza etc
This Game Might Be Better Than MLBB tbh
Very good. Well
Huge problem bug net poblem😡😡

"I was disappointed when I couldn't play because of the matchmaking, I waited for a few minutes but I still made the matchmaking, maybe there is something wrong with your matchmaking riot game, please read and fix it"
Terms of use were completely unreasonable!
"Buy only if you really look Ike monopoly. You will get one board only, any adicinal thing cost extra 5£. Disappointed"
非常好，非常好用 Very good  我真的很好奇你们为什么说不好用，我用正常的很，通知关掉不就安静了，自己不会关，还冤软件。 装扮用免费不要会员的不就好了。 真不明白你们这些问题都是那里来的? 关于关了网络弹的通知，这很正常，所有用网软件都会弹的好不好? 人家那么写是富有幽默感 QQ唯独就自启烦一点，其他都很好，下个360禁自启不就完美了? 真不懂你们
"i cant even use the application, it keeps saying that i am not on the newest version when i try to register an account. please fix"

For some reason my game just stops working. I'll be in the middle of a level and the game just stops. It's really driving me nuts. Please fix it
Love your game
"Very fun and enterainin! Ok played for awhile now, I must admit watching ads is sooo boring..in this game you must watch a vidio to clam your daily prize, and a vidio for your extra goodies , and a vidio for anything you come up in game ..so the small amount of fun is over shadowed by the amount of time you must invest in watching ads to get goodies...Im out..."
Lags on galaxy a53

Best game ever
"Will ruin your phones screen. Permanent giant blue blocks top and bottom(left and right horizontal). Lack of options to fix it and make them black or changing. Also color is blue, the worse color for phone burn in. Controls are also clunky and respond slightly off. No easy controller support, or cheats. Just no encounters, nothing else."
Good fps on mobile. I have not played a better one
The game is really fun and takes a lot of patience
Nice play
#FREEFORTNITE
Amazing 👏
"i cant even use the application, it keeps saying that i am not on the newest version when i try to register an account. please fix"
it's awesome and has and had so many glitches and it was so funny seeing them all! And just the newest update is so cool I can't wait for 1.20!🤞🤞🤞🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 and a quick bible verse (Genesis chapter1 first god created the world and the universe and light sorry if I didn't get something right but ya Minecraft is so good 😊
You should fix the add issue and you can see everyone's reviews
"I want to say about this game, this game is so good I request you to add mic feature in this game THANK YOU SO MUCH"
很难用，体积臃肿
this is a extremly fun game keep up the good work
Please my game is freezing always meanwhile there is much space and there is also a good Internet connection. I deleted the game and downloaded it again but still it is happening please help me
Good game
Love the different summits
"Sometimes framerate goes awful, and sometimes the signal is awful, but if youre wondering about the signal im using a wifi which could run any video at full quality and doesnt buffering"
This is the game!
This is game cool and more cool
hello rockstar game I love your game but there is a problem with gta san Andrea's when I try to sign in it says an error or a on the social club even it's the right information please fix this bug 5 stars
Very Best Game
This is cool game
"Is a good game and all but I'm missing multiple of my character cards assassin kitana, classic liu Kang, hellspawn scorpion, cold war scorpion and subzero, circle of shadow liu Kang, all the day of the dead characters, ravenous and vampires mileena, classic scorpion and sun zero, strike force scorpion, shoals Kahn from completing the tower, black dragon erron black and classic jade and mk 11 jade I had all these cards before the gold and diamond exchange and when I got back on they were gone"
This is a great game. Since we are a cell phone I think we should be able to save whenever. Maybe you guys could work on that.
Glad the game has been fixed. Thanx for fun and lots of repetitive but replayable action!
Nice game!
I resetted my pw and this piece of garbage says I still can't login bc Internet unstable... I have wifi full signal and I just resetted my pw??
The best game ever
good game but the game contains ads but keep up the good work
Nice game Have to use brain
If u see this if you are on mobile and your screen glitches click the roblox icon aka where u choose to leave and click it and close it realy fast Hope this helps
Thus game is awesome...
👍
I think I love that game
Don't download please guys 😱 This software tells you to look for Pokemon outside the house and makes it smuggle you😱😭
Game will not load after I hit new game it does nothing
I like the game but I think there should be boss fights in br
Nice
Not very friendly to new players. The hire hero is only once a week? Do devs live under a rock? This feature in other games is available more often. This is the bread and butter for newbies. Similar design issues are all over the place.
Beyond quality
"I have recently problem to run the game, when I allow to download game data .. it crushes. Im using Samsung galaxy Tab A7, and I should have enough free space to download those 800MB."
🤗👌👍👍👍 good game 🎯
A spin off of hunt royal and I'm here for it
Pretty dope and cool
I love this game haven't played since I was a kid
Ruined the game with changes
I like it but it sometimes lags i still love this game 😉
Pubg Mobile is a world best game ever
"Very good concept. Relaxing and challenging at the same time. Random idea from my mind : add a hardcore mode where when you destroy multiple rows in one action, the one closest to the center disappears but the other ones get blacked out, therefore limiting the play zone. Edit 17/02/2023 : it's been a month-ish now that the app is SUPER SLOW on startup, freezes for 5 full minutes. It sucks, might uninstall, sadly."
"I would say three stars on this because it's on the offline stuff and when I get out of my internet it's online it says ""please connect on the internet to continue"""
Love the game<3
Catdog
Best mobile game ever
Really nice and good but I don't know how too find more mission
This game is key to life
Would be a better rating if it weren't for the almost 2 min Iong ad. Jeez I can play the game in web browser for free no ads. Another joke of a game with zero effort developers. Way to go guys..............
Great game
It's hard to play but I like to play because of the gameplay
Hi I like free fire And you ment no to possibal Indian sarver You ruqest plases indan sarveer You got indain sarver
SONIC FAN
I love this game. It's very fun to play. You should give it a shot 💫. The only thing is they pair you up with a high level player. Please fix the matchmaking. Overall it's great 😊. Edit: The game is not as fun as it used tbh =/. They're making the game more of a kids game now with every update which Im sad to see it changing 😔. It's hard to win nowadays because of players already max cards and such. I don't play as much nor I enjoy playing it as before =]. Please making it as before 🙏 😥💙.
"This game is good , nice graphics and almost all the thing are God but Only racing games can sometimes bore so in my suggestion you can add A open world for driving like Forza Horizon 5.....I hope Asphalt 9 add this feature....This will make the game more interesting.... Please add this feature"
Hello after some data resource data download my super Mecha champions keeps force closing I'm using a Google pixel 6A helppp

Nice control everything is nice
It was realistic and fun
Noice
Thanks for game
It's so fun
"Hold up, I paid for this game before and now because I got a new phone I have to repay? Same account mind you as I paid for 9 as well and still have that. What gives?"
The only problem is the ads
Good Game
"I played for 6 years on other devices and just got mobile recently, it's not as good as console and PC versions of the game but it's good."
Nice game full enjoying game
Great game
Just started having fun will review further down the lane
I don't know why pokemons flee and no items from poké stops I don't spoof.
"Great game, however is a little hard farming cc when there's no event"
"It took more than an hour to download, but when it was downloaded, it reseted like I never downloaded it, and before, when I tried to make an account, it won't let me bc of restricted area, when someone has an account and he's in the same area"
It's a good game but what kills it is melee and it should get nerved.
"I love the actual game but they can't control the advertisments they show, I got a weird ad saying I won a Aldi voucher that was obviously a scam."
Pro
Thank you sega for this great md game you made my day yeah!!😃😃😃
Xf
This game is amazing
"Best 3v3 game and had alit of brawlers to play with, but the removal of the boxes made unlocking brawlers less exciting."
🤤
Good experience
درود بر شما که این بازی لذت‌بخش را برایمان آماده کرده اید.ما در ایران به خاطر تحریمها ی جهانی نمی‌توانیم خرید داشته باشیم لطفا برای ایرانیانی که بازی را انجام میدهند ارفاق هایی را در نظر بگیرید.
Very good quality
Kewl
very good game specially the skyblock
BEST GAME!
Sonic 3 Classic
I think you need to fucos on upgradeng of the game and the Mecha not on the skin of the characters and I think you need to ban all players that use cheats and hacks and I think you need to give a aurora 2k shield just like the others mecha And if that's happened I will grow up my 1star tl 5 Star
The bedt
My opinion is that it definitely the best remake if it is awesome
If you guts added a FNAF addon for free i would ratebit more than this (all of the FNAF stuff please)
It stole my account but that game is good i like asphalt games
Great game very realistic
Love this game by far the best dragon ball game out right now

The game play is fun and all but the constant maintenance is annoying. The necessity of crystals makes the game less fun.

I was just in Act 1 Green Hill when I finished the level in 44 SECONDS
"Awesome! They have 2 of my cars on here which is a Fiesta ST and Focus RS/ST. The Fiesta is just as quick as mines in RL. Stage 3 mods. COBB accessport, COBB stage 3 tune, Whoosh Catless Downpipe, MBRP full exhaust system, SPEC stage 3+ clutch and aluminum Flywheel, Turbosmart BOV and ADDW1 oil catch can. A couple of more mods and then I'm done. Next project will be my Focus ST! WOOT WOOT!! Again like I said, this game is awesome 👌 👏 👍 😍"
Kalahari map back please 😭😭

I just bought every house there is so nobody was able to buy any hotels. It was only a matter of time before I bankrupt everyone and started swimming in cash.
"OK, I love this game but I gotta say, the Adventure sync needs work. It will just drop out whenever it feels like it and I've wasted about 3 poffins because of it. It's crazy how I can literally go run a mile, and come back to see the adventure sync say I've walked 0.02 km. As someone who can't play regularly adventure sync really helps me save some time, so please check it out"
Verry nice game
Played for 5yrs. Great game.
Was a great game been hacked and full of cheaters big don't play
Amazing
"lagi asik² main malah reconnect apacoba, pdhl WiFi lancar bgt coo"
I love super sell Thank you brawl stars
Unplayable. It says insufficient storage and bad networking despite I already have enough free storage space and good network. I've tried everything of these methods on how to get in and it isn't working. God damm please fix your game
I give 4 star for 1 thing the gacha system is super annoying I think I spent 10k gems witch is a lot for mui and ui Goku and a nuther 5k for gogetas and vegetos but other than that I love the game. It takes a lot of grinding but I'm sher up love it.
Wonderful ☺️
This game is very nice
"Been playing Monopoly since I was little ,I always seem to win...."
Fantastic
I like
بوٹ اچھی گیم ہے B
You need to fix the evil dungeon money cap with the jedite dragon you can easily get over two hundred thousand gold pieces because the bosses drop blue hearts you can activate it seven or eight times a run which.can trigger the third party cheating notice it also happens with up close dangers I get this warning as well I want it to stop i.am not using third.party just the dragon statue that can get more gold.
I think I love that game
"I love the game, the graphics, game play, character design, everything. Everything except the price of the diamonds, the price is a little too much."
It's literally THE BEST racing game you'll find on the play store
I want to say that is game is so good but I request to add mic features in this game plzzzzzzzz
Honestly been 3 years since I played still a 5 star game
"A bit pricey on some levels, but I am currently loving this game!!!"
Very fast and easy to play
It's a good game and I will play . It's fun
Clash Royale can be a fun and challenging game for players who enjoy strategy and competition.
"Wow! I love me some good ol' Clash Royale. The boys and I always be clashing on some good ol' Clash Royale. Back when I was a pro clasher, I loved Clash Royale. Clashing on Clash Royale always makes my day! Gee wiz, this game is surely a great game. If I could recommend someone to Clash on some good ol' Clash Royale, I would certainly recommend some fun ol' clashing on Clash Royale!! I love Zaza!"
"In this past three seasons, issues regarding ping spike and fps drop(even good device) are never been resolved. Giving ticket in this game don't mean a thing,in the end no solution has been made. Updates so far getting worser and worser that game crash getting common in most players devices that even specs won't be able to do a thing. Suggesting us players to send ticket in this game webpage is nonsense, this matter is something to do in how you fix this issue.Dont make us hate this game!"
❤️❤️
Nice graphics
Mast ✌🏼
I don't know why but an ad is just on the joystick which makes it impossible to even move forward
Love this game there is many type of Bg Tubers And i like [ coldy - blockmango] I love this game <3

"Got stuck trying to reach the savepoint in the slums, in the stacked house next to the bar.... not cool."

A classic on the go
This is the best game ever.

It's a good game and I really like it but there's a lot of people who can just go in there and installed like hachi toads in a lot I wish they could refix that but they won't think they will but I hope they do realize that they need to and like then it'll be a lot easier life all it takes is still and then you're good
I love to play and relax myself stress gone best game to kill time it's not boring game. We feel great when playing this game
"This is a very good game One problem though,I sometimes quit the game in the middle of the room and then like usual,I got put back a room with all monsters killed but suddenly I took the damage that I took in the next room even though I quit the game in the middle of fighting the monsters"
Enjoying the game but can easily be come a money trap..be like me f2p
Cool bro

Classic. Golden.

Eww I'm over this game as of now. I hate that in the battles people with a much higher battle level and way higher CP pokemon than you are put against each other it's effin ridiculous. Save yourself the high blood pressure and the urge to throw your phone at the wall and not download this lame a$$ game
feeling like katrina with no fema
100 years waiting loading to start
very nice game
THE GAME BUGGED UPDATE THE GAME THIS MY FAV GAME I DONT WANT LOSE MY DATE PLS
It is fun
"When i started playing this game a month ago it was running great and in a month i got to max level of 27, but then i started facing multiple problems like not getting the rewards as shown in the loot and, the start screen repeating itself between hub page, Wargame page and login page. I really love this game but, frequently like i missed NikoStopper Gun and Tesla, though i have them in my inventory but you never know which particular Gun has best combination of Perks to help in Overall Game."
Nice

My husband has the game and he can use stars to unlock colors. Why cant I earn stars? Edit: the next day after posting this I was able to earn stars. :)
The game it self is very nice but it got to a point where if you don't spend lots of.money on it you have no chance of progression even if your really patient and play daily events and all extras you still no where near to progress it's has to get blueprints youhave pay lots of money otherwise it will take a year to unlock the cars you need on top of that every mode has a pass now 1 for multilayer 1 for legend seasons 28 days £8.99 and the. Newest 1 is for daily events £5.99 14 days
Why did you delete the map that you make robots?and please bring back the boxes
Interesting Game yaar
everything in this game is good but the penalty is just annoying it takes to long to get into a match.. hope you will lessen the penalties
👌
Wow😘😘
Nice
I love thes
It's a good game I really like it!
"This game deserve award for most annoying game ever, Please give me some one at my level"
Always a great game
Tetg
The game is fun but it keeps on kicking me out I've really get internet so most likely it's the app or more than likely should I say
The free version is 90% ads. I understand paying allows for the ad free version but this free version is unusable with the time wasted waiting for annoying ads to finish
It's a good game tbh I used to play this game in 2019 ngl it was a good game and apart of my childhood I give this game a 90/90
I can't even open the game today for some reason and it refuses to wanna work. I was just starting to get back into it and this happened so until that changes I'm not changing my review
Bun Thoeurn
Great game that isn't pay to win
Super game
"It took more than an hour to download, but when it was downloaded, it reseted like I never downloaded it, and before, when I tried to make an account, it won't let me bc of restricted area, when someone has an account and he's in the same area"

Very good
Uhm can you optimize it for low end device I think you guys are forgetting about us who play in low end device I play this game btw I'm a old player but I quit because its become lagging because of the new ui but its cool ui i just want you guys optimize it for low end device and put low graphics because medium is not enough so thank you for understanding So yeah I hope you can understand because I only have 5 fps. Edit:thank you Moonton company I hope you guys can optimize it keep it up❤❤
Games pretty good misson kindea hard to do espcally in the 4th story all the way to the end its kindea hard to get crystals i think thats how you spell it but the characters are good lots to chocie from but whe you try to get a good unit its kindea hard to get it all bassed on luck wish you could change that but overall very good game.
I love this game because it's just like GTA 5 mobile but older
It's an alright game
Very nice game
I am unable to login with my supercell id as i am not getting any mail from supercell for verification plz look into this ..
Perfect battle royale with robotic theme. Just please give us an option to choose map between alpha and origo
I really like this game
Refund plsss
This game really sucks. It used to be my favourite game but not anymore. Everything in this game is all about headshot headshot headshot.
After playing for 3 days the game just shuts down itself and can't continue the game no more. A waste of money
عالیه
忘记密码说我版本过低 你自己在谷歌上就是最新版本

So dumb yoe
#FREEFORTNITE good game BTW
The game is not working.At first I enjoyed this game and now it's not working.
As of now some functions dont work. Cant even claim certain rewards nor blacksmith plenty of items. Not even sure if my progress is saved seeing as theres no google play login of sorts that i can see. Currently giving me a notification that use of third party apps could cause a perma ban. What 3rd party app? Edit: apparently i just needed to close the app and force stop Still not sure if my progress is being saved though. The google play prompt shows up but i only see the option to do fb login
Love it...
It has ads
Bad losers ruin it. People get angry that you refuse trades or that they are losing and stall the game by viewing and reviewing properties so their turn won't time out. There is no safeguard against this kind of behavior and it ruins the game.
Can I play without controller or keyboard in Android?
更新到 Android 13 后，这个应用就不好使了。无法和电脑传文件，因为系统权限不给它读取手机里的文件。
Funn gamey
Great
Not as much fun as it used to be...
Brilliant game. Wish i had more money though to upgrade. 👍
Bloatware chatting app with lots of useless feature.
Little tap to steer issues but perfect
Good ig
I will recommend this gome as my #1 game.
One of the all-time best RPG's that exist!
Ad free ($3) scam bought twice and now doesn't work
Very cool
NICE GAME EVER 😎😎😎
Noice Op Good
"I remember this game in my childhood. I would play it every day, I owned everything. Now its ruined by the excruciating ads all the time. And why the hell are most of the item categories ''under construction''??? When I was younger everything was there, working and fun and definently not ''under construction'' this game is ruined."
"Either the cupons don't work or something wrong with the play store. Waste of a £5 coupon, doesnt load.... Apparently I earned, wouldn't know it."
Stress buster
Refund plsss
So cute pets
New update 3/27/23 sucks. The tabs across the bottom have been elongated in Android visually a step back need a cleaner UI this one is a mess so much I almost want to uninstall I've played since the beginning
"It's a great game, the controls are initiative and the graphics are good. I like the global challenges and I've never come across any bugs. I've had the game since it came out and I still love it."
Best game ever
Pubg Mobile is a world best game ever

"gosh bless christian whitehead for this remaster, absolutely the best way to play sonic 1, minus the ads being super jank"
"This game is very nice, but 4 stars because there are levels which are very hard and it takes many days to pass them, and also it takes 30 minutes to refill each life. Earlier it took only 5 minutes to refill a life. Please fix some of these problems."
Buen juego solo que le falta buen emparejamiento
This is a good game but today my game is not opening 😟😟😟😟😟😟😟

Great fun game need more love players!
Love the game but why change what has worked for ages. I don't like the undo at all
"I'm a Chinese. Beening using QQ since 1997. The experience worse and worse year by year. This app at google store is speachless. I have nothing details to complain,but all and every details wrong. Tencet well done!!!!"
Trouble loading right off ! Hope it improves.
"The game uses extraordinary long and oftentimes completely inappropriate ads(not family friendly, lying and so on) to generate revenue."
Love it.its so fun.
Wonderful
Its to gud
"First Off, I'd like to say Thank You Moonton for making this game. it is so addicting and so fun to play! The gameplay is realistic and smooth it's just perfect.. however.. The prices are a bit over in the in-game shops so I would like to recommend you to lower the prices just by a bit Other wise this game is the best! -Raaish"
Waste of data
Sooo lag even though I have a good internet.
"Awesome game, love all the retro games that I can play on my phone. I use a ps4 controller and have had no issues with controller lag or glitches."
I really like the fighters but the new rose one is just pay-to-win my friend paid to get him and he beats me in every friendly pvp
But this game is very beautifull but and unistalll game and reinstall this game not download in my phone my phone is redmi not 8 6gb
For some reason my game just stops working. I'll be in the middle of a level and the game just stops. It's really driving me nuts. Please fix it
this is a good game but if you don't like killing or Ragdolls don't play this but to me it's really fun and easy for me! I love this game try it see how you like it and rate the game!
Best ever
This game looks very cool 😎.
"Annoyed, I've had this game for quite a while now. I used to enjoy the game. But with the few recent updates, there are new additions without tutorials. And, ads are crazy. Ads every time you lose a game, ads for boost, ads are everywhere. Not fun anymore. I will be uninstalling."
Root
I. Love the game 🎮🤩🤩
"The only issue is the internet connection My interest is so fast (1,5 mega), but it stili with out con"
Amazing I've been playing since alpha
Love you
Why is it 1.2 gigabytes
Can't register need help !?
Too many ads
جميلة جداااااا ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This Is One Of The Best Football Game But The Only Problem Is Unfair Match Making. FIFA Should Make It Fair For Everyone To Make It More Fun Other Than That Every Thing Is Good In My opinion. Thank You
It's crashing & won't open all of a sudden
Fun game you can choose your new weapon attire often
Great game other than the fact that it shuts down a lot but I think they mainly fixed that
Ty it's installed I love it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😶😍😍😍😍(♥ω♥*)(♥ω♥*)(♥ω♥*)(●'▽'●)ゝ
Only if it had real people and some maps and some guns and robots tournament prize money and more updates every week and 1v1 2v2 3v3 last 6v6 mobile pc Mac Nintendo switch you name it
Great game
Plzz me dowland game pubg i am not hacked but i am very locl plzz me pubg
decent game but it's insane how much space it requires/ takes up in your storage and the ads have gotten way too excessive.
The game is very good but i think you need to add a report button because there is too much team up in solo
"Great game, but I have a problem, I couldn't leave the clan or delete my account because "" Connection Timeout "" or whatever it says idrk. Is this a bug? If it is, please fix it. That's why I rate it 3 stars tho."
"Thank you for your advice, but it still doesn't work, and I've tried looking for other solutions but they also don't work, due to this I lost a lot of my original account due to the re installing it"
لعبه رهيبه

It keeps saying that I need the new version to create the account. I just downloaded the app here. It doesn't even work. Horrible
Good App
it's very good game
Wow nice game
Love this game.
Its okay
Worst game . in the utoty section when you play a match it mostly gives you player not of your level most of the are world class . I CRIED I SPENT MORE THAN 20 TICKET TO NOT EVEN WIN THE 5 MATCH
Best game so far
I love this game since I was kid😍💖
Really nice 👍🏻😊
Really good game it's addictive graphics are very good. Customer care support is also good.
Great game
Literally unusable
Www
Why I'm not able to reinstall this game
Super game it's mine jog favorite game forever stress away I love the game
Greatest game ever made
nice
"Love how you randomly make ""retry"" on opening the app and not letting me access or even make a NEW password for my account. Six times now?! Damn pokemon go and damn its owners to hell."
"This game is near perfection, and it feels so close to achieving greater potential, it just needs more work on gameplay and performance, if the performance is fixed, bug issues repaired, low frame rate issues are fixed and some polishing is done, then this game could become the next big thing in the battle royale genre"
"I've played this game for years. My record stood at 74,000 for many years! Problem now is the new safety nets they've added to support adverts has made the game too easy. I can always get myself out of trouble. Current score 133,000 and cruising. I liked the brutal structure of only having 1 life. I feel like everyone with a little skill will be banging out 100,000 scores."
Hello garna my recoding sistem no working you helpe me
I love all the candy crush games.
Hhh
Nice 🙂👍
Has to update when u install it in then when u delete it then re in stall it it has to update
Play any tym with net connection and njoy ur life
Best game ever
"It doesn't let me login, it doesn't let me reset password, very slow network, but I am using 5G. It says the version is too low, but it is the latest version from Google store."
"This game is good , nice graphics and almost all the thing are God but Only racing games can sometimes bore so in my suggestion you can add A open world for driving like Forza Horizon 5.....I hope Asphalt 9 add this feature....This will make the game more interesting.... Please add this feature"
It's difficult to get any good characters like ultra gogeta or ultra Goku black but otherwise it's a good game
Epicly epic
"It's very good, but make finishers more common in matches. Otherwise it runs great and the finishers (When they happen) are fantastic"
Super
dear free fire team map mein not third party application apps but my account suspend but why I know understand my emotion this free fire but why suspend my account please recovery my free fire account please
Nice game and I love you
It's cool and fun
This game is sooooooooo much FUNNNNNN!!!!!
Best game ever quality better than PlayStation
"Worst PvP experience ever. I waited around 30 min & couldn't find a match, not even a bot. Matches with real person are very laggy."
Getting stuck in the middle of the game please fix the issue it ruins the fun in game play
"If you're looking to start or return to the game, don't bother. They just launched a terrible update that nerfed both F2P and those who buy the pass (while raising the price) and are also adding a new card level which will make the game more P2W. They also clearly don't listen to the community. Find a better game, this is a sinking ship."
Best gacha game you can play with a lot of content and not pay 2 win. WORTH IT
Shafted again!!!
Updated not to standard
Stress reliever nice 100
cant log in. tried so hard explaining every single text. if you dont want non china people from using it then why post it on play store dumbass
I like the app its really fun but its hard to build :/

Hello garna my recoding sistem no working you helpe me
This game looks very cool 😎.
Awsome
"OK, I love this game but I gotta say, the Adventure sync needs work. It will just drop out whenever it feels like it and I've wasted about 3 poffins because of it. It's crazy how I can literally go run a mile, and come back to see the adventure sync say I've walked 0.02 km. As someone who can't play regularly adventure sync really helps me save some time, so please check it out"
Diss game was fair good and I love the store for some gamers is it good for you
"The game is fun but played this app only once and now it won't open giving me a message stating ""Unable to initialize the Utility Engine."""
Fine. But the summon in the game is totally waste as instead of the character with higher percentage rate does not appear but the hero units with less percent appears again and again. Summon sucks but Gameplay rocks.
Fix the issue in free city rp lagging

Best game ever
Great port but the ping issues here in the Philippines suck if these continues it will be another Arena of Valor. Edit: 3yrs ago I reviewed this and still the lag issues in the Philippines still not fixed. WR is becoming more like aov dead game in the making 🤔

"Fun game, loved it when I was younger, now I can play whenever I want :)"
This is really fun I'm gonna lie.
This game was better......but now it's become trash 🗑️
"Fix your game ranking and chat, this game sucks with no communication ."
"Riot!! Plz fix your game! After recent update, it has been constantly crash mid game and during in loading screen before the match started! I been getting punished for afk because of this problem! My phone can handle heavy game and i have been using every single method i can think of to fix it! So please do something about this! I love playing your game, but u gotta do something about this please!"
"After playing the game, yeah the change it's actually good... Anyways add more quest and reduce the time to have quest c'mon this isn't clash of clans, it decreases me to want to play this game."
W game
Very fun game.
I LOVE THIS
Really good but needs less ads

Worst app if the year. Seriously just remove the app and get a better ui designer and stuff. Obviously penguin doesn't know what human likes and want. 0 star.

Best gacha game you can play with a lot of content and not pay 2 win. WORTH IT
"I play in low end device. Even though the game lag much and I face many bugs , I still love this game"
Lately I've been having issue 277 when my internet isn't the issue. Please fix this
It is so fun like you can add mods for it and buy new worlds for Minecraft.
I love this game 😍
ALL TIME BEST MOBILE GAME
A great game. But lately keeps offline not allowing to access crates and races
"Way boring game, items are small, the game have so many confusing details and differs from the (misleading and annoying) ads. Therefore, I don't really want to learn the game because it's just boring Uninstall"
Lagging and pink game
"Match making was too long, It takes a lot of time to play, hayst"
Love the game but a lot of things don't work on mobile. For example I can't get past the dancing/low rider missions because the arrows you're meant to click just don't come up. Can't progress now.
Gud game bruv
Nice
it's amazing i love it its just awesome I do hope that you will like this game
The game connection keeps disconnecting despite the fact I have strong WiFi and / or 5gs
The game is prite good but TO MANY ADDDDDDDDDS.
"I used to play this game on my Nokia 10, and it could never be better, now on Samsung F13 with 4 GB RAM, I can't stand the lag, LAG IN FRUIT NINJA? unbelievable"
Great game
Not. Best. Game
عالیه
TIER 3 SUBS ARE SIMPS
Petsim x are scam because they have bank bug issue that they not fixing
"Disgusting experience with this game. It's full of bugs. But even if you ignore bugs, its impossible to play without a group. If you use a third party software to finish raids which are basic things then they slap you with a ban. Thing is in my country they dont even give enough pokestops and gyms also for people to play. They did nothing to improve the game. Concept was fantastic but implementation was drastic. Most important thing, their approact towards their CUSTOMER is just pathetic."
Nice my mom doesn't let me to play on her phon
It works alright for me. Except for the occasional game crashes. But the motorcycle minigame at Midgar is too fast. Gold Saucer is still a legendary time sink.
I love
Terrible controls. The entire screen should be the dpad - press left/right anywhere on screen to move left/right.
Nice g
Good game ♥️
"Not getting the confirmation messege. It says update the app, but i also have the latest version."
Final Fantasy 7 is one of the best. Glad I can replay it on my mobile device!

Awesome game
"Oh man, been playing this game FOR YEARS. My favorite part was that there was no undo, when you lose you lose. Can't believe this update."
ONE OF THE BEST FPS I HAVE EVER PLAYED
"I've played this gam for years, finally bit the bullet and paid to have ads removed. They then had their update with the back button and extra pieces that you have to watch an ad for. While it's nice I don't have to back out of ads every few minutes, I wish the new update was part of the no ads."
This game is so enjoying. I play this game everyday to get log in bonus and to complete the daily missions and to collect the rewards.I also play PVP and Tournament of Power and I like them.
Mc 🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
Beyond quality
It's so good
Fun time waster!
AWSOME FUN GAME TO PLAY 10/10

How upload you game update the game was so big it was not start small mobile and not start slow Internet people don't like big game
I love mortal Kombat iphone games just instead my old Xbox one console. Back thin I was love to watch mortal Kombat movies and playing videogames since I was 2 or 3 years old back in from 2001 and 2002 I think ?
Best game f2p friendly too the characters design are cool The Game mechanics are so easy to understand and mostly the story is so great!!!👌
Naic
Played game for years loved it! Thank you for standing by your game and making sure all the customers are getting great service! 😎 👍
"An amazing game, but I'm having a little issue with my friends joining. I can send an invite but when they accept it, it tells them that they're unable to join and I'm usually on wifi. I'm not sure if it's my Minecraft doing that or there's. Is there anything about that that can be explained??"
"Super fun, fast and simplistic game play. Great graphics. Tons of versatility"
I think u should add the fall damage cause this doesn't make any sense I suggest adding the ability of watching ur historic Especially in MP As well as adding a TPP practice mode and some br maps Btw in Fpp br u must make everything Fpp Like landing and some vehicles Every other details are insane like graphics weapons customization..the game is really realistic
Nice game
Wow
Cool
The new update us garbage. I highly recommend don't play this game if you are new or a returning player. Look for another app and save yourself disappointment.
Super game it's mine jog favorite game forever stress away I love the game
My old map is not available
Awesome 👌 👏 👍 😍
"Great game. I especially enjoy the events and there is something to do every day. A few weeks ago I even got the 180 day login badge. I've wanted to spend some money on because of how much I've been enjoying it, but this being my one issue with the game, even the cheapest options in the shop is very expensive. My guess it's probably because the prices are being converted into my local currency. It would be nice if there were more affordable options though."
"The update is too large, you should consider to update in minimum for some user who has storage problem. 2 months worth of patch and update in one go is too much for our storage. And tbh, the matchmaking suck. 3 consecutive games with a afk teamate. Reporting someone who's stolen your assigned role doesn't seem real then why put it there?? I used to love this game but I might consider playing other moba until the matchmakinh is fixed."
Goty
"This game is good I like it but how can we do split control in this game I wanted to play in split control so, please add split control in the game. I'm giving it 5 stars for its performance"
Op
One star ✨ because I always get 4/3star girls
Fire game
Like bro no one literally no one asked for new level and so much more grind for no purpose now the game is even more p2w and they just proved the community that they don't care about what they say because even the most known cr creators were against the new level
Best game ever i love playing it it is really cool and it can be modded
Game became p2w
I like the experience but I have some thing that always stays and stops my gameplay
Cant even delete friends nice
love
"Amending my previous positive review. Climbing was doable before. Currently, the duo lane has either Tristana or Caitlin for adcs. Everyone else gets stomped. Was on a 5 game lose streak trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Then, I got placed in the infamous ""playing above your rank"" queue against a bunch of masters as an emerald. If I'm playing above my rank, why am I losing? I am sitting on 42% win rate while getting put in ""playing above my rank"" every 3-5 games."
The game is very nice. I just love the game because of Anime style.
I love Sonic and all but the controls can be a little janky at times and can make me make mistakes I just need the controls to be fixed so I won't make as many mistakes and get as many game and maybe some other people might need those controls fixed as well
Nice car game lol

And why the hell are most of the item categories ''under construction''??? When I was younger everything was there, working and fun and definently not ''under construction'' this game is ruined."

In this game I obtained 1195 tokens in the champion ship site. But later it was reduced to 985 tokens .I'm very sad what happened to me.The game is good but it is good if the championship site bugs can be minimized

Pvp is absolutely trash in this game!
Very op game
Very fun to play but beware! It's addictive!
i rate 1 star because it lags like hell also it say minecraft isnt responding every minute please fix that
wow..so cool 😎
The on screen buttons only register my presses half the time. It's really awkward and frustrating to play because of this. I keep trying to push the A button to progress the dialogue but it doesn't register my press so I keep pressing it from different angles until it does. I barely played for a few minutes before giving up because of this and I'm genuinely considering getting a refund. But I also want to try and make it work because I've heard good things about this game :(
This game is very good I love this game
PLEASE UPDATE A LATEST VERSIONN!! BAD APPS
Wonder fully
I love this game so many different challenges
Nice Nice Nice Nice game I like this game 🎮
Go battle league is full of people cheating. Players on iOS can root their phones to be able to get more charge attacks then what is normally possible. It is past time for Niantic to stop giving three strikes before permanently banning an account. It needs to be one and done after doing a sweep of iOS players using third party apps to cheat

One of the best game that I have played on my phone
"The in game purchase needs to be fix, it keeps saying the app doesn't support billing payment"
It was better before the new update now it's just boring to play and get new brawlers. The boxes were better.
How to play with our friends??? Is their any option???
But
Pathetic game interface
"This game is very good. It allows you to build your creations, play with other people and socialise and more! It's a great game for my children. With the new exciting updates, I can ensure that my children could play."

"Do something about xeno zen player , habby , cheats for months the same way , in duel he chose skills and dont enter room , times runs out and nothing , you have to surender to keep playing so he wins , im sure he does the same to all"
Best game f2p friendly too the characters design are cool The Game mechanics are so easy to understand and mostly the story is so great!!!👌
"I don't know how but this game is full of either scammers or bots, almost every game I play a player ends up giving up either all his properties for a few dollars or a single property that does nothing to help them, last game someone gave someone the final green space on the 4th side of the board for 15 dollars, no one would give you that for nothing in return, they player who recieved the money had plenty of cash, they got no properties in return and all the did was give other player a set"
"Drevo tazis, kamene kopes, domy stavas, jak otrok sa spravas. Kto by bol len povedal ze je to taka sranda. Odporucam pre ludi co nevedia co robit so svojim zivotom😀"
It's good the graphics is good and a very smood controle i love it but when u first play it ur VS bots for a long time which makes me kinda mad cuz it's easy but the bigger rank u get the harder it gets and u go VS real players so ye after all its good. I would give it 5 stars If they would add more free rewards in the BR pass cu it like 2 free stuf per 5-7 tiers so that's kinda all I never had any issue so te game is very good. Thanks for the hard work u guys put in the game!
ITS A VERY GOOD GAME NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ALL THE CHARACTERS I WANTED BUT BECAUSE ITS MY FAVORITE ANIME AND HAS THE THE STORYLINE IN IT ITS PRETTY FUN TOO
"I've always had an issue with this game. It feels like enemies' attacks are telegraphed poorly. Some enemies' attacks are way too subtle, or their projectiles blend in the with the background, or the projectiles look similar to your pets' projectiles. This is all stuff I've waited for years to get changed."
Fun
very addictive
This game so good for me
👍🏾
It's amazing I love shooters

My #1 favorite game Highly recommended
It's dumb
As a beginner The matchmaking in event is so 🗑️ 🗑️🚮 My chemistry is 68 and my team ovr is 90 then opponent in vs attack or h2 has 100 chemistry and team over all is 115 above and also a fifa champions or word class in UTOTY/HM event can win not even single win.
This game is good interms of graphics but it needs gyroscope.... Then it will be 5 star
Nice great
Incredible game. I played the Java version of Minecrat since 2012 and the game just gets better everytime!!! (Actually the uptades just get mid everytime)
"My skateboard doesn't even work half the time! I mean, if you build a game revolving around motorized pizzas, then you have to at least get the yogurt right."

"Worst game. Rigged matchmaking. I did an experiment. Built a deck only good against the 2.8 hog cycle. Haven't seen one since. 100% rigged don't play this game. If u do, dont give them you're money. Bad faith game makers."

"Fine game. Highly competitive, really futuristic in an acceptable way, fine characters, diverse and customizable weapons and so on. I love d game.

"Shared the game with my daughter, she reached level 7 but I didn't get any rewards like it claimed I would"
Great game. Childhood flashbacks
Best game ever
Works better than Vice City. Carl can climb obstacles and hes good with an smg.
The game is good but this mission is a vary hard and boring So I don’t like this game
Super
Riot  Fix the rank system; make the rank system difficult so that the stupid players only hang around in silver and gold. Stupid and toxic players will go to the master.😩
I love this game its Amazing
"Do not play this game. The main reason I say this is lag. Impossible to get into a proper fight without being stuck in the same position for al least 10 seconds. No matter what phone you play on, you cant say the game hasn't given you lag problems. It really pisses me off. I have a really good loadout then lag. I'm there for so long. And then an opponent kills me. Happens EVERY TIME. Would not reccomend. Epic, fix your game."
Just 👍👍😊
The best game
wonderful game 👏
Cool
I grew up playing minecraft bedrock when I was 6 And I love the game
"I hate this game it has ruined me. My alt gets everything I want but can't get. He just got ultra Rosé on the first summon, but on my main I've spent over 6000 CC and still haven't got him. Just add pity already."
ALL TIME BEST MOBILE GAME
Works better than Vice City. Carl can climb obstacles and hes good with an smg.
Love it and forever will
Good way to kill time
Fun
"The update makes my phone heavy and slow, it sometimes even freezes it until I restart the phone"
Super the game.👍👌😘🎁👏👏
Fun! Fun!
Md asad
Very nice app 👌
I really love the game it is wonderfull it really gives the full expierence of the dragon ball history and the series but I hope they go on a lot more with the story also more ways to get more summons
I can't play it in my 512 mb ram phone.It only run on the lobby and it crashed.when I try to start a match it crashed.you should reduce it's file size and make it sweetable for lowend devices.
Good luck
Roblox here it is again. there is this 1 bug which isn't letting players make their account. The animal thing. its hard and when you finish it all it says you didn't do it in time. and I can't even do it because of the thing. i have tried to make an account and I can't. So freaking annoying. and also the audio bug. its just stuck there after your done with all of the options. please try to also make an Fast mode for mobile and pc. it would be really good if you do it. so yeah thats it. bye.
Good morning
Good
Best mobile game for PVP ...... ....
Fun to play when playing with friends
Excellent
i like this game😇😇
Very good
It's feel like you playing a gundam game
The game runs smoothly
Can't even log in.
It works alright for me. Except for the occasional game crashes. But the motorcycle minigame at Midgar is too fast. Gold Saucer is still a legendary time sink.

Good to kill
TO MUCH ADS!!!!!!
It wus amazing
"Ads ads ads. Ridiculous money grab. You cannot do anything without watching ads, you cannot advance without watching ads. Or you can pay 7 bux a week to get so called vip. Truly awful."
OMG roblox is the best game there no more games that is better than roblox
Kooliest
I would love to give this 5 stars but all of the dialog has been blacked out and I have no idea what is being said. Some of the world gets blacked out as well and I'm stuck with my character running through a blank screen at times.
Joos app
Good🙀
Boblox is great
"I wish it was more ways to win free boosters & gold bars, that's my reason for giving 4 stars because some people don't have money to pay for a game all the time I see sometimes."
I love this game. But the puzzles with the character stopped very soon. Also now there aren't enough side games and the game is becoming monotonous. One more thing winning on the spin game is almost impossible as I've won the bonus once. And I'm up to level 4000. Not happy
Very good game
It's a brilliant game you should try.The first game I have seen ever seen with no lag.
Boring.
"1 reveiw Blockman go is a good game 😀😀😀but hecker are in the games pls ban annoying games hecker and 1 youtuber hecker he is telling how to hack in blockman go ban him it will be 5 stars in everyones reveiws plsssssss🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 2 reveiw some player are lot of doing pay to win and abeuzing in lot of games like bedwars,skyblock etc etc and sowing how cool are they by lot of pay to win and some of are toxic players and i am not like toxic player abeuzer player pay to winer hecker but good work"
Bringing back my childhood memories

Its a good game i enjoy it very much i just think oneday ima go too the doctor and the doctor wil ask me bro what u dping u have high blood pressure and ima say doc i play call of duty with my friends and thats whats giving me high blood pressure🤣🤣i love this game met alot of awesome peeps
Regardless of bugs or fixes the game is broken. They give you to many skills and by the time you have a series of blasts and star skills or massive attack speed or just simply more than 10 monsters inadvertently took including your spirits and possibly some summons (or 6) the game starts lagging big time. They need to upgrade the game dynamics so people that want to get to top tier levels in the game can do it comfortably
Great Game
"Disaster,,, poor connection, poorest servers, not even worth s single star...thise who love football just play it for passion n fun bt fifa has a real business perspective... At least provide least good server connection to the users who belive u... Just dnt do nonsense arround them all the time. Improve ur game developers..."

best game ever
Its minecraft who doesn't love it lol It's the best
I love this game
A great game. But lately keeps offline not allowing to access crates and races
"A faithful port of the original game to Android. While not perfect, most of the bugs are worked out and it is very playable. I've been playing this for awhile and love it. This game is legendary, and no Final Fantasy since 4 has come close."

Best Game Aver (and free)
It's worst game I ever played in my life
Really loved it
درود بر شما که این بازی لذت‌بخش را برایمان آماده کرده اید.ما در ایران به خاطر تحریمها ی جهانی نمی‌توانیم خرید داشته باشیم لطفا برای ایرانیانی که بازی را انجام میدهند ارفاق هایی را در نظر بگیرید.
I love this game... When I can get it sometimes I can get it into the game however lately within the last couple days I haven't even been able to sign on or get past the very intense of the game
I love this game so much
Cool this is game
Worse
hif
I lost my account :(
Its incredible ❤️
Superb 👌
Very nice game
Nice hme
"I love this game, I'm actually quite happy with this port I have 1 bug to report, and one small complain. The bug I found is that if you use a Bluetooth controller, it disables the onscreen controls, but it doesn't re-enable them once you disconnect the controller. The only way to go back to is ng on screen controls is to close the game. The complaint that many of your other ports have auto battle, and or fast forward that make playing it so much nicer."
always requiring update to connect to friends. Updating fails too often requiring additional troubleshooting. I just want to open it and play with my kids without hassle. Not too much to ask.
I love this game so much but I'm unlucky with the character hahahah but it's alr I love it
nice
Awesome
Its a amazing game but it takes a lot of space to download and update
Interesting

Love it 😊
This game is very nice

It has built-in update service other than Google store
Cool
I love this game
The Worst game ever. Very irritating. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Controls don't work properly.
This game is verry funny I like this game
"Like the game of course, but the aggressive ads are ridiculous. Four verifications to end an ad is beyond absurd. You do realize we can emulate this with a rom with way more functionality, right? There is a limit to monetizing old stuff, and this app exceeds that limit"
"One of the best JRPGs, Controller works but give us the option to turn off the onscreen controls when a controller is plugged in"
I install this app for 2.3 gb and the installing time shown there is problem with installing and i wasted 2.3 gb.
👍 👍 👍 👍
Good
Worst update March 27 2023 Uninstalling.

"It's a very good game but If u gonna play on mobile play on a tablet u get a better view of the game and more stuff put if u really want the best version of roblox play on pc or controller because u get more buttons, because I was playing a game and pc players had more buttons so make ur u play on pc buts it's ur choice this game has alot of goofy ah people to"
"Just as good as the original it might even be better. Edit, once you get farther it tends to need begin freezing up frequently! Like damn, I already had to uninstall before because of this"
It is awesome and good to play
Your nettheralm pack is rigged it aint giving me diamonds ive been opening 15 packs
"After update today, there's connection problem, disconnected and cannot back into the game"
Has to update when u install it in then when u delete it then re in stall it it has to update
"This game is great, still the same fun mobile game I remember from when I was little. I don't hate watching ads, but the game has a very annoying glitch where watching an ad will make all audio from the game disappear, and it won't come back unless you reload the app. I also think that making any in-app purchase should disable ads. Despite the devs saying that making any purchase would disable ads, I still get them after buying a special offer."
Its a rlly fun game!
بسیار عالی
"When you start a game, it automatically pauses."
I love this game but the hackers are not being stopped. Ppl using a grappling hook from last season. Landing with weapons during initial jump. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT TEN CENT! You banned my old account when it was stolen. I reported it while it was happening and the thief used hacks. I lost over 3.5 yrs worth of game purchases and it pisses me off to see your not stopping the REAL HACKERS!
Too few PokeStops to justify how many pokeballs you lose while looking for Pokemon. It's like the game is trying to get you to pay
Ads so long in the game
Bazishe harf nadareh damEAgarm mersii az baziton
New customisation needed for new looks l
This game was an absoloute legend but it has a lot of ads that makes the game unplayable
Ilikeit
I just hate everything why do you people give me IN PVP YOU ALWAYS GIVE ME MUI OR SOMEBODY WHO HAS ALL ULTRAS THAT STUPID
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
Thank you for fixing the Cloud saves.
Scammy
Ads ruin everything!
Epic sucks. Epic customer support sucks. Epic launcher sucks. Don't drop money into this pit
"Annoyed, I've had this game for quite a while now. I used to enjoy the game. But with the few recent updates, there are new additions without tutorials. And, ads are crazy. Ads every time you lose a game, ads for boost, ads are everywhere. Not fun anymore. I will be uninstalling."
Best of all time! 🫶
Great entertainment
I like this game spacially fifa world cup 2022
It doesn't work no matter what
Is cool the is game is cooooooooooooooooooooooooo
rubbish login & recovery system
It's is amazing
Nice
Really good but one thing I should we not recover my old account is not transfer data please help me in this mobile really good thank you my I'd - name ultra pro
My favorite game!
One of the worst season of COD Our Expectation is very High this time but when play the game now is worsted season total waste of time to play. on this season Cod Disappointed Us 👎👎👎👎👎👎
This game is awesome😀. I have never experienced such game ! I am now a fan of Dragon ball! If you ask me which is the best game for dragon ball. I would say this! And it would be better if you provide a summon where we can get 1 tag unit with one ticket and that one ticket is only recieved once by login and twice through event.
Op game I love it
Save Iris leth me teach you super omnislals wtp7777
Deleted the game until you fix the matchmaking
So far so good~ u like mecha anime? This is the game u are searching for..... Or curse like other games u need to read what does do any weapon plus is brand new all weapons are different and powerful no matter what weapon u use is OP it depends on how u used and whats ur fav. Update fron 2019 to 2023 game died like in season 3 🤣 its barely alive but only in the Chinese server
"Way way way to many updates! Very data intensive! 3, 4, 5 gig updates not even a week appart! Ridiculous!!!"
Good game
Great realistic racing game
The best game ever I played in my life
Yea i remember why i quit the game.. the dance after every mission is disgusting 🤦 its dumb
Great as remembered. Only bad part is chocobo racing and snowboarding. They have severe lag when participating in either. This is #2 of my top three Final Fantasies. Time for a sequel to FFT WoTL! Which is my #1 favorite.
Pretty fun game altho the combat mechanics can be little sluggish or maybe it's just my phone.
The best game ever
Lots of bugs as of recently.
Good
This game to much on getting skins or pilot or mecha gotta actually spent big money just to get good stuff crazy game crapy dunno that I stop playing it for like 4 months
Nice keep it up
Fun game but too many ads
Very nice 🎮
Sonic is cool and I beat sonic 1 and on final zone was pretty easy after I tried and tried again.
Love the game. Playing for almost 5 years. But the only thing which I hate is that the game requires extremely stable and speedy internet. I am able to run 1080p videos on YouTube but the game shows me the internet issues everytime. Please fix this supercell
MST game hai 2 star isliye cut hai q ki kabhi kabhi ads aa jata hai

Very very very very bad
Good times
This is the ragest game I have ever played
Very addictive.
Lot of fun
The game runs smoothly
Nic game
It's a pretty cool game but the ads are like so common
Netease games is garbage
I like Game
"I got this free via the Play Pass. If you're buying this, wouldn't recommend. FFVII will always be amazing, but the controls here are so clunky and unoptimized. Other versions on other platforms will warrant a better experience, in addition to having things like speeding up time, invincibility, if you so choose to use that. It might cost a little extra on other platforms but for the controls alone it's worth it. At bare minimum this game should have a way to connect Bluetooth controllers."
i can play w my crush an i loike it but it should have more free mods for it like in the game so u can have alot of coins for free for starters
Go
I lost my account but this game is lit🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Il rate this as a 4 star because of the lag and also the matchmaking we low rank players are fighting a high rank player with a skill diffrence in mecha skill that makes it unfair to new players or still learning the game i hope you guys can improve and fix the matchmaking of the game.
The game good
"Ok update this game keeps crashing ....it's says ""broken file please re install game "" I have played this game up to 18th ranking then it loses it data developer needs to fix this permanently this is the best shooting game on Android I hate to give this a one star"
Its good game super nice to play
It's amazing. The game just plays amazingly. My only thing is I wish I could play Final Fantasy 8 like I can play Final Fantasy 7 on my phone. It's a perfect Port of Final Fantasy 7 to the phone and it plays really well.
Mr beast
Very best Roblox copy (:
I love it cause it's mindless fun. The update is good and I like what was added.
Good
Can't play offline. Still dope.
"dont get me wrong with 2 stars i mean i love this game but it needs more optimization, i play on my tablet mi pad 5 with 120mhz but i only get 60fps"
Cool game good graphics and fun to play still even after 5 years of playing
Jogo interativo e divertido. Pensa e age. Qual jogo não tem isso e com tema de doces!
Great game!
"Wayyyyyy tooooo laggy whenever I face against players. My internet is not so bad at all. And yet the game lags everytime I'm fighting against other players. Aim is not smooth. Whenever I aim, it's shaky even sniping is a bit of a pain. The game could have been better if the framerate didn't drop while fighting other players. It's completely annoying and getting into my nerves."
Great as remembered. Only bad part is chocobo racing and snowboarding. They have severe lag when participating in either. This is #2 of my top three Final Fantasies. Time for a sequel to FFT WoTL! Which is my #1 favorite.
Even tho I was hacked and I lost all my pets in Adopt me I LOVEEE Roblox
This is one of my happy places. The perfect game to organize my thoughts with.
Ho ho this game never end and never delete
Good. I love this.
The Best interactive game ever!

"I am currently playing this game,but for about two weeks now,I have not been able to do much,as I keep getting told ,,it is updating. For goodness sake,how long does it take to update!!?? 27 March 2023. I am still waiting for the game to update ,so I can start a new area. Once it was 44% updated,then it went back to 0%. I have tried the help group,but no luck there. I even left a message.😡😡😭😭🤔🤔🤔"
🔥🔥🔥🔥
nise
When playing this game the connection lost server
Nice game but some things that i don't like
"Other than the game bugs, the game is ok. Though, after some time, i started seeing more bugs. I've reported them and, there weren't any changes. For example, there's a bug where you can't continue your mission. Some others...include player's being restarted to the login menu. Game nice, although 👍"
Game crash on sega intro
I like this game
DO NOT DOWNLOAD Ive played this game every day since launch and slowly watched it become more and more expensive to have full functionality. This 12 dollar price hike is greedy and disrespectful to people who have spent hundreds if not more hours playing.
"I remember this game in my childhood. I would play it every day, I owned everything. Now its ruined by the excruciating ads all the time. And why the hell are most of the item categories ''under construction''??? When I was younger everything was there, working and fun and definently not ''under construction'' this game is ruined."
My problem is sinh in Why
My game is not loading and opening
a game that's fun to play
I love the game it is really fun and easy to play
Amazing

BMG is good game but I request of the devoloper plss make PvP tournament and choose 100 best pvper in this game

"So much to do, so much to learn. I suggest watching some YouTube videos before you play"
I love this game
The game's actually fun and addictive and from my pov everything is ok with the game but I don't see why we can't trade or upgrade old special upgrade card now I've got up to 50 bronze 2 upgrade card but it's just useless and I still get more as I login into the game Pls just let us be able to upgrade them if you do so then I'll rate 5 stars
Nice Car Smoke :)

"It's nice and interesting as well as makes you think, just wish there were easier ways to know what to do to 3star some of the maps."

"doesn't count steps anymore. I've left the game closed for some time now, when u open the game, it never counts the steps that have accumulated (which is many). really sick of trying to get candy when the game doesn't even do what it's supposed to do. this is probably why I put it down for months. the time has passed, Pokemon GO is another to only be opened seldom now."

"It was probably my favorite game back in 2018, but now I see no one playing the og games that a lot of og players used to play. I feel pretty old just looking back at how much the community grown after these past year. I'm pretty sad I did lose my rich account but then again I wouldn't be playing this game now or somewhere in the future but it was fun playing this game and being able to paly with friends. I only wished to meet them in real life so we could communicate more. Thank you blockman go"
I love this game this is one of the best games I've ever played on Android
"Download ta game but can't able to play it shows error wifi connection, necessary data download problem issue..my phone is latest... problem in your app not in my phone...pls fix this issue"

Love Monopoly.
"The game frequently forces you to buy and spend to offshoot the purposeful sabotage the AI during autoplay (switches players so they can die or before making critical combinations), slowing gameplay to an impossible craw when attempting to play on your own. Setting matches up for failure. Speeding opponent response and actions while slowing or inhibiting personal moves."
I love this game there's alot to do but for some reason my legends double relay isn't working

"It's irritating that they did away with the ad-free version of this app. What is even more annoying is watching an entire 30 second ad and then the game saying I skipped the ad, thus taking away the reward. This is happening almost everytime now and makes me want to just delete the app for good. I always keep my app updated, so that's not the issue."
"Sigh, the ads and7 extra moves have disappeared again please put the ads and the extra moves back in the game. The extra moves and ads in the game have disappeared. These levels are increasingly harder and some of us need the extra moves to level up. Mr King. Please leave the extra moves so we can advance, win a quest, etc Your attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated. Elizabeth"

"Back in 2016 this used to be an excellent time waster. I understand the need for revenue, but the means by which Zynga generates said revenue has and always will be atrocious since they are fans of long, constant motion ads interrupting/ distracting from gameplay. Buying ad-free requires your actual card, you cannot use your Play Wallet (asinine). The special effects are equally distracting and the game was perfect before they started the power-up nonsense. DONT BOTHER, ITS ZYNGA."

"Over the years since 2015, I have seen this game devolve into something no more than money loitering, ways to exploit children, and gambling in which they take zero accountability for anything that happens on their site and off of it. Most of the user interface that are ""staff"" is ran by bots. False reports and false bans happen 24/7, and you will be ignored and forced to wait until the time is up on the account until it's lifted. Do not recommend to have your children on this site."
The best dragon Ball game but there are some bugs in low hand devices
"I accidentaly overwrote a new account over the main one, can i somehow get the old account back, pls respond!!"
Bad
Sucks on the switch put better fps
This game is good been playing for years
Nice game
"[Edited Oct 2022] Back in 2016 this was a 5 star game. It's the only game I've always had installed. I even paid for it, which I never do. Since Zynga took over they've tried to ""improve"" what was a perfect, simple game. They've rolled some changes back thank goodness, but the current state of play just isn't fun. Plus, I couldn't even watch an ad to ""undo"" if I wanted to, since apparently none are available? This is no longer my go to game. Zynga ruins fun, great games once again. What a shame."
"Good game but 18years down man it is bat.l play this game 2years but i don,t iterest"
Fun and relaxing
Got a new phone and needed to log in again. Password is not working and can't recover or reset. Trying to set up new account and app will not send verification code. Useless app! Don't know why the international isn't available anymore. They even have the balls to ask for my passport number!
hello the best game
Adds
It used to be a fun game. After a year or so I started playing again and they make you watch an ad to rotate a piece which is absurd.
I'm the pokemon lovers
nice but we need a old traning ground and free item'
Fun engaging game
This game rocks!
Kiki ol
Ok.
Why does my game keep crashing
This game is the best I have ever played it's so fun with good graphics and everything
"Buy only if you really look Ike monopoly. You will get one board only, any adicinal thing cost extra 5£. Disappointed"
Immediately froze my phone. I couldn't do anything on my Flip 3 after it said it required Wifi to download. Took forever to figure out how to restart my phone. Don't bother with this game!
Hi I'm a kid I like the game it's really fun thanks for creating game
"Not so great anymore, latest version on Android crashes often"
Valo
I've been playing since 2019 then comeback in 2020 I was playing a game I think it was called weight lifting simulator 3 in 2019 when I downloaded roblox. I found the game wl3 boring and deleted roblox 😂
Best
You're difficulty levels are clearly rigged.
Fun game you should play it I do every single day
Download nahi ho Raha hai
The game is great but it hang
Thank you guys your massages hall me not to download the game thanks

Hi i Need Help Phone Me Poco X4 Pro New Updite Crash To Island Why? please Game Fixe Crash😰🤕🤕
Good
Kool game
Very low than Asphalt 8
"A pretty good port, but the controls make anything requiring precision IMPOSSIBLE. For example, trying to sneak past aeris. Game broken."
Superb
Fast and fun!
It is not atall optimised for android my device is OnePlus 7t and while I play this game there is never ending lag
The new update us garbage. I highly recommend don't play this game if you are new or a returning player. Look for another app and save yourself disappointment.
It signed me out for no reason
Game of the year guys💀
Ho ho this game never end and never delete
Pourquoi avoir modifié le mode 2v2? Je désinstalle
Used to be really cool cause you could join other people's worlds but for whatever reason they got rid of it
Nice game
nice game
"What did you guys do, the battle royale is now too easy but it still a good game"
"Really fun game. but I have a problem about vehicle glitching after freezing. Often stuck in the wall or ground or even another vehicle. Some reload animation is stiff. But I appreciate it, it makes the game lighter for mid end"
Hey guys i love it thank you for making it and updating it.
Good
Fun
It so nice game I like because everyday I want to play this
"Hello , Now I installed this , very good experience Never ending fun , ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF GAMELOFT ."
🔥
Randomly opens from times to time
Excellent .
Root
I used to love the game but ever since the updates the game is starting not to be fun anymore fix the game or bring back the old PUBG..!
Nice game
I love it here
It's a very good game and has very good animations and fights.But it needs some updates to give chrono crystal free as they are releasing many summons.
"Mad ptw. Ain't willing to spend 100 USD just to get a character in game. Summon rates are terrible, yet it takes 1000 chronocrytals to buy a stupid 10x summon to get a bunch of low rate characters, and there aren't a lot of ways to easily get crystals. There is no SBMM which literally takes all the fun out of playing PvP, and there aren't enough events or anything to keep me really entertained. Overall in my opinion, this game is pretty lame and i wouldn't recommend without tons of money."
Nice great
Having synchronizing problem after updating.
Sad incorrect password 🔑🔑
It's an interesting game player
Hey block man go to the unke sat gai
Beautiful game
Incredible game. However the matchmaking can be VERY ANNOYING at times which makes it not the best game for people who rage easily
"Crisp, fun, and forgiving. Only problem is that it doesn't save what you have purchased with stars between devices. Other than that, great game."
Man so 👍
You can hack the game and play as super sonic
Vest game
It just takes all my stress away and it's just the game to play
i think it is good there gliching prblem has been done now it is very freely ill give this a five
Its so funny
Bug fixed
Can defeat free fire
I love the background music
Excellent
"Well I made a website on this and that helps me be a pay to play so thanks, you guys get a 5 star because you helped me make money"
"I hate how the game gives you a load of top tier highest rarity units right at the start, completely ruined my progression experience"
"This game is super nice, and it's not super hard to play. I started yesterday and got 6 1st places in a row, and this game is incredible"

I. Love the game 🎮🤩🤩
"I love this game very much because it is not just for boys but also girls! ,And also the game is very very fun to pay I rate it a 5/5"
Great
Cool game
I LOVE FREE FIRE
This game is legendary but I hate the fact that I'm spending over 20000cc on this game just to get ultra Goku black
Cannot install the update.
I need get v badge
Good game🎮🎲
Wonderful
Trash game
Waste of time
So far so good. I need more time to play before I can give an honest score.
Just waiting around for a game for over five minutes after update new games
"Hate the recent big update. The hang gliders used to make sense in where they were, they were all in high elevation areas so you could actually go places. Now they're just in whatever main location you felt like putting them, tried using one in Stalber and it closed within a second. My next gripe, vehicles, you guys messed up my controls for no reason. You used to be able to do subtle turns with the steering wheel controls, guess who messed that one up? You guys."
Good gameplay but celebration very bad so it fix next update please😭
Awesomely fun and exciting shooter/mecha mix...Keeps me entertained for hours. Must try!
Great game
Classic nostalgic feel. However it's just a cash grab and super cells very greedy.
Super 100
You should fix the add issue and you can see everyone's reviews
The graphics are brilliant best racing mobile game ever
"Good game, I play regularly. Takes a little too long to finish restoring cars unless you are willing to spend decent money out of your own pocket. Also get sick of watching your reward videos, whether for free fuel or another part, and then not getting the reward. Wish it was a little less ""pay to win"". I understand development costs $$$. But it's ridiculous how long it takes to restore a car without having to pay. Edit: Game will not load at all now.🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
Good game. Way to many apps and some way too long apps.
Not updating
I LOVE SONIC ❤😃
Hey there.....i've been playing this game like my entire life......and i uninstalled it some years back.....now i'm trying to redownload it and what do i get an error message saying you cant download super mecha champions....plz netease just plzz decrease the size.....like it was some years back because i've almost wasted enough money plzzz
"Perfect, It's FFVII on mobile, some slight problems, like thte safe in shinra mansion, but it's FFVII OG on mobile FFS, don't let the malcontents in some reveiws put you off, get this game and enjoy"
This is a great game but mission is less so i want to upgrade the game and extend the mission make more hard stages in it Because we are all bored playing games my friend So this is my request to all my friends please upgrade this game as soon as possible and increase the mission thank you
Fun game but don't lose your Facebook you'll lose your games
I love the game but it keeps crashing whenever i load the game it works for a while but then it just stops working even tho i have a new phone and a stable internet pls fix this
Paboritong Laro
"First of all Great game, I hope you keep improving the game specially the lag issues and match making coz its ruining the game. Please fix it asap 🙏🙏🙏"
"Me too, error last update"
Fix your damn servers!
Ok naman Siya parang ml lang.
"Fun but a few things should be corrected. The app should allow us to select ""custom rules"" while playing multiplayer, only allows that when you select the ""online with friends"" mode. Next, I cant play with other random players when i select the ""online friends"" mode. Also, we should be allowed to chat in game, there's only a drop-down of selected texts that we can choose from. And, we should be able to add random players as friends with just their name instead of needing a code."
Nice madam 👌 👍 👏 😀 😄 😊 👌 👍 👏 chod
The game is awesome in a whole different level
Az
It's a really great game to play
Really good game
"Aw-ful. This game now SUCKS. You are forced to endure endless 30 second ads. Or, no ads at all in which case you can't advance at ALL. Ads. Ads, ads. Infuriating! And the ads FREEZE so when you try to go back you are told the ad was skipped and you have to start all over! It seems to get worse all the time. I wish I could give it a zero instead of a one! AWFUL GAME."
Love is game
That was grate
Keeps throwing you low elo teammates
Cannot download the game and it's really got me upset this has been one of the best games I have played and now for some reason I can't get it on my new phone lame.
"Online games needs a timer for players, or something!"
Cool
Love it. So good
شاندار
Uujk
It is good 👍👍👍 very nice
Thanks so much for this game
It keep kicking me I can't play anymore and also the missions are hard like the racing ones
Nice
I'm not able to sign in
Excellent...but my new phone can't play it. This game had bugs for ages but they were fixed so I could finishes it with my S7...but the S22 isn't looking good :-(
"I like the game and all but it is becoming way too p2w. They nerfed the free side of pass royale and added an extra diamond tier that's even more expensive. And if u buy the diamond tier, u get ARCHER QUEEN NO MATTER WHAT ARENA UR IN!!! Not to mention LEVEL 15 COMING TO THE GAME!!! As a f2p player, this will make it even harder to max out my current deck without spending some money. And u wonder why people quit the game early."
I have been asking for weeks to delete my save on the game but still nothing has happened and nobody has contacted me about it. Why write in help if nothing will be done. Still waiting and it's been over two weeks since I first asked. I have sent my ID and I don't think I had it reset before. I have been asking for two weeks now and still nothing
Nice game
It won't load in a Samsung galaxy S20+ with the last updates.
"I was simultaneously playing this game for months to get my score higher each day but all of a sudden, after almost 3 months of playing, it suddenly closed by itself and when I opened the app again, my game was ended and I have to play a new game FROM 0 AGAIN. It made me angry so I'm giving 1 star"
Best 2d game with controller support I was actually finding a game like this which have controller support and when I played this game I was like it is the best game in my phone and in my phone there are 1000 of games but from them this the best controller support game BTW my phone is glitching now BYEEEEEEEEEE
Updating my review. Always been my favorite game to play. Keeps me busy and doesn't get old. They have fixed all the crashes that used to happen and have even the updated the game to make it even better!
"March 27, 2023 update finally killed this game for me. Ladder has almost always been terrible. Clan Wars 2 update killed my clan, but I still hung around. Moved over to 2v2 to play casually and still got Pass Royale most months. Today's update has killed 2v2 and is attempting to force players to return to their crummy ladder system. No thanks. Solitaire Planet is cheap and a great alternative to this game. No game breaking cash grabby updates. Just cards."
There so many task.
The Mobile Legends: Adventure video game is pretty cool and I like it
Love to moving all the time
👍👍👍👍
Your game should be banned.
Love it!!!!
"Please update the game!!!! After the update , the game runs but with no music !!! Only sound effects. How am I supposed to play this masterpiece without a soundtrack ? I am using a Lenovo tablet and have never had this issue with any other game."
Best game i have played after supercell games
It is super fun but I don't like how you have to have stuff to actually play a match
Spent years and thousands of dollars playing this game on two accounts. Over the past few months I haven't been able to play. I have now returned to play the game to find that leader to my clan has been given to someone else. I had recently got a new phone and didn't receive any notification or warning. This is nonsense considering I spent over 10 years building this clan an it's now been given to someone I don't know. Restore my leader status.
Good
Fun fun fun
Definitely not have that anime ai
I think this is the best game app.much fun in it
It's still just as fun as it always was to play. I like the vibrant colors and soothing music.
Pd
Seems to be fair and no ads
"Please fix mp ranked lag, especially in hardpoint."
Great Game to pass time if you love cars!

Magandang gabi poh PUBG MOBILE nagpapasalamat ako dahil binago nyo yung pubgm sa mga low end. Nakakapaglaro na ako ng maayus smooth na sa OPPO A5S. sana naman poh wagnyo nang baguhin always na ganyan para dina ako magquit. Kakainstall kolang kahapun. Ngquit ako dati dahil madami bug at napakalag nya at framedrops laroin. Sana naman wagnyo baguhin napaka smooth na sya ngayun. Yun lang poh samalat
Nice game though... but contains bugs sometimes. Earning souls in the game is too hard but spending it is too expensive and last of all you need to add fatalities in battle mode too. Aslo add story mode that will make more sense the this game.
Too many ads in the ad supported version. After an ad plays it pauses ur game an then it plays an ad whenever you try to un pause it.
There is a learning curve to this game. Still do not understand everything
Do your cars don't have driving wheels? It's not a race
Great game so adicting play it every day
This game is the best .
I liked the game quality and its graphics cool
Only suck
I like legue of legends but your myn
I hope I have gold cubes TwT or just Good friends
"For the people saying it's pay to win, it's not. I win 100% of my matches. Won 8 straight as of right now. I haven't spent a cent with this game. If I can do it anybody can. I'm not a superhuman. Stop blaming the game and try to get better. I was also bad, but practice will always make you a pro. Don't give up."
Nice play
Music does not work outside of cutscenes. The music for the title screen doesn't even work. This definitely needs to be fixed.
Darshan Bhosle
Love it's graphics and the all features in it 🌟
"Its a good game but when playing mulitplayer once the human player leaves and the bots take over, they make stupid trades giving out streets for almost free to the others. There should be a time penalty of not being allowed to play given to the players that leave. Also a ranked system with obtaining points for winning and a ladder system would incentive players to keep playing."
good veri good
If you play this game you go drink garri choke 😂😂
Just amazing
ok
TRASH 🗑️........
"IVE played Computer last4-5 hours and each time computer and dice was predictable!! I can literally be an multi billianaire at Vegas by predicting EVERY single move!! And If Your about to tell me that BS,about the dice algorythm, DO us All an Favor and STOP the Blank LYING to your supporters!!! WORST Monopoly GAME Ever Created!! ONLY decent way to play is Online!! And If no online connection, This Game is SH!#$!!!"
This game is lit! Highly addictive and satisfying.
"The best racing game I've played so far. It's has better gracfics then CSR1. There are new faster cars, harder challenges the whole shabang. This game keeps getting better and better. Until March 16, 2023 , where the game asked me to update it. So I tried to update it and every time I pressed update it did nothing. Now I can't access race pass, crew hangout, nothing. NaturalMotion is there anything you can do to fix this problem and get back to me PLEASE?👍"
Used to be one of the best games around. Now there are too many ads. Unplayable. Uninstalled.
nice
Brilliant 👏
It is okay
Whenever I try to open game..my devices become staring lag and automatically they become switch off..what is this warner bros company...fix it I have old account in this game...please fix this issue ASAP

"hey i have been playing this game since 2018, but now it doesn't log in with google play, i get 100,000 point, and didn't get the achivement, and it doesn't save my score."
"I like this game because this game graphics, cars, racing tracks and car upgrading is excellent."
"Game is pay to progress and nothing has changed for years ! Nice graphics, smooth intense gameplay, good sound all ruined buy pure developer greed! For me to upgrade my hero at its current state would cost me over £240!. To regularly update the heroes and weapons to progress that would cost like £600 -£1000 a month! Game developer never listens to the players about cutting the cost of the game and being able to buy specific upgrades for the weapon or the hero you have!Can't progress ,Stay away !"
great game. has been for years. do you have a server or forum for vehicle suggestions?
This game is very best
very nc
I don't mind ads but this app showed viciously racist propaganda videos. I Uninstalled and had to put my phone through the dishwasher.
Great
Very best game to time pass 😉
"Ok I had to rate 5 stars again since we can now change our lobby audio theme with a few old seasons audio theme, hope more of them will be added, like the og season 1 original soundtrack and the one from Going Dark, amazing feature, thanks CODM, this was definitely one of the things I wanted the most in the game. 🙌"
This game sucks it wasted my 1gb data
Bad and worst app. No english found
The new security is trash i cant log in to my acc because of the phone
Love the changes and the new limited edition background options. Thank you!

"Love it, but wish tablet would flipping work!"
"Very good game, enjoy playing with friends"
grafik very good.but this game not recomend for new player..very hacker in here.sad for topup and buy skin
"It's Monopoly. It goes faster than regular Monopoly. There is no need for a person to be the banker. No setup or keeping track of property cards. The one complaint I have is that it is impossible to cheat! Win if you can, lose if you must, but always, ALWAYS cheat!"
When update is coming
Wowix
i want to install but i cant install why
So nice pls the green sign and black screen problem solve plssss my id name is PSG ovr 108 level 17

"The game needs new updates: improving the stability of the game, such as animation, movement, the quality of internet servers, saving data, progress, and thank you for responding to the opinions of players."
Expectional gameplay
Op
This Game is a good I would rate it a 4 star but 5 star if the 1.20 update is good update But Loki Craft is Worst I would rate Loki Craft 1 Star I would play this in 1.20 because it has trim armor it would be so fun in the 1.20 Update Have a good day :).

"A faithful port of the original game to Android. While not perfect, most of the bugs are worked out and it is very playable. I've been playing this for awhile and love it. This game is legendary, and no Final Fantasy since 4 has come close."
Fun game
I do not have any daily gifts I hope you can fix this glitch
"Good game, really enjoy it,at least make the game A.I to buy my players because I have been waiting for months now ,just to get them sold . They haven't been sold still 😭😔. Also fix your problem,why do I have to press a button 3times just for it to work , rubbish"
"The game's good don't get me wrong, but it has started to kick me out of it every time I try to claim or send a gift, try to battle a gym and now also whenever I try to get into the game. I hope this gets fixed!"
Very addictive
"Tiresome but awesome game , really would have played it but it doesn't go along smoothly and very mundane monotonic theme gets set"
"Very satisfying game, just wow!!!. Love it..."
It just gives an error about upgrading to the latest version when I try to sign up.
no ads so far awesome
Roblox Is very fun I love it but the only thing I hate about roblox Is the removal of so many audios I miss Rick rolling people I miss playing my favorite star wars tunes but now there gone roblox please bring them back

Great
"Used to be great but the fortnightification of all things is inevitable, people liked it cause it was ""realistic"""
"The game used to be good but after the last few updates it has become one of the hardest and worst games ever, it became so hard, higher trophies people became noobs at the game because of the huge amount of brawlers they added, 50 brawlers were enough!"
This is a great game but mission is less so i want to upgrade the game and extend the mission make more hard stages in it Because we are all bored playing games my friend So this is my request to all my friends please upgrade this game as soon as possible and increase the mission thank you
Just marvelous

"Worst game period ever, this game is slow divisional is stupidness gameplay horrible. Gameplay is awful they cant pass a ball properly they can't shoot the right way this game is thrash total thrash. They need to allow people to play the game freely an stop interfering my Gosh this is sickening mentally. This game should be ban, throw away in the garbage."

Just love this came. It is epic!!!
i like minecraft because aphmau play minecraft 100 time's then roblox and among us and im there favorite fan
It's fun. It is sometimes challenging.
He he he this game is really fun after kicking the buddy the gift you get you really don't need to wotch the ad after some time a x comes so ya i liked a lot he he he.😃😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😈😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💖
The reason why I gave this game 4 it's because every time I play a game I always get out like I was getting kicked out or disconnection and it says fix my Internet but outside my Internet is perfectly fine and I'm thinking maybe there's a lot of people in roblox but you need to fix your disconnection and I'm not writing this paragraph not trying to write this paragraph in a mean way I'm just saying because every time it always kicks me out unlike 5 minutes or 40 seconds And I don't understand.
"The game is a 10/10, the only little thing is that you have to start matching players based on theyre stats, not on theyre rank. Because there are a lot of iron players boosted into diamond and master, who are ruining games constantly"

Black ni game for reta ky all
everytime something would pop up on my screen there would be nothing to get rid of it and they forced me to buy no ads
"This used to be my favorite casual game. For years, I would play when I felt like it (sometimes hours at a time), then take a break for a while, before picking up where I left off. Now, if I go away mid-game, when I come back, it shows me game over despite not having lost by backing myself into a corner. I have to start over from scratch. It starts a new game, new score, but because it starts by wiping out my previous progress, I already feel like I don't want to play. Because what's the point?"
"Runs great on my Pixel 3 XL. Just finished a playthrough. The only bug I encountered was the pause button during combat. When I suspended the app while paused, froze the whole game. Simple fix: don't use in-game pause. Just minimize the app. Otherwise, it's an excellent port. I highly recommend for JRPG gamers."
"Brawl Stars proudly introduces you to LGBTQ...if by now the game was rubbish bec of the well known factors,now we have to watch a well known flag whilst playing.Well done,""gays""!Sorry,i meant ""guys""."
Best game in my opinion
Good
"If I could give zero stars I would have. I couldn't even play the game because it kept saying internet needed something like that but I have wifi and it was on, going to uninstall.not keeping a game I can't play"
Best game

Nice game im so gland to play this game
"Of course I am giving Final Fantasy 7 a full 5 star rating! This game is one of the most sought after RPG's of all time. It's true that the game is completely broken in many aspects, as there's always new bufs and glitches being found, but even so, this entry in the series is just too good to dislike."
very nice
Super unbalanced

Best game everrr 🥶🥶🥶
"It's JUST SO GOOD to relive my precious gaming memories. FF7, Chrono Trigger, The SEGA libraries & more!"
Game is Good
"Do not dare to delete this app , but dare to install"
Nice game
I like Minecraft but I spent 4.74 just to make me uninstall Roblox and I will not uninstall Roblox just to get this game
I like This Game And If you want a New Moile Play A Brawler With 700 or Higher Trophies in ShowDown
I love the game so cool
Good
The game is very boring now. Some level are just unbeatable. Can u believe am still stock in a level for more than a week now. If something is not done about this I will just get read of the game and download other Fruit crush game.
The best legendary game in the world. I love it from the bottom of my heart and you will love it as well! Thank you Rockstar for this masterpiece!
"Love this game, I did lose all my data recently but I blame that on my phone.. But not happy about the community day times being 2pm-5pm. Really inconvenient. Much prefer 11am-2pm time slot"
"I gave 1star, only because of poor matchmaking in game(in championship mode bot like teamamtes come, they don't play or don't use super etc) and some players also cheat in solo mode by teaming up bt no action against them by makers of the game..it seems like makers not interested in solving or improving all these type of negative points"
Problem my network was not working so you minus my hounor score why i hate this thing
It's an amazing and fun game and ive actually played it for the PS1
"Beautiful skins , high quality, better quality"
"Ma mise à jour ne veut pas s'installer depuis des mois. Je suis toujours bloqué à 26mb. Wifi ou données mobiles, c'est la même"
Super super
"The best MOBA came to android! Here are the pros: 1. the gameplay, it's very dynamic and interesting. 2. optimization, the game flies at 60 fps even on budget phones. 3. Champions, there are many of them, and all have their own unique story. There are no cons! Thanks to Riot Games for the mobile adaptation of the original LoL!"
"I hate this game it has ruined me. My alt gets everything I want but can't get. He just got ultra Rosé on the first summon, but on my main I've spent over 6000 CC and still haven't got him. Just add pity already."
Loved the SEGA game
Lololol
Very good
It's challenging but Awesome
frequent errors where I need to watch the same ad 3 or 4 times to get one reward
It was realistic and fun
"Great game! But the problem is Dev's have stopped actually updating the game, so no new content for players to enjoy."
Love the game it gets regular updates I even spent money on it
Terbaik
Love on xbox pc and mobile and ps4
i have a lot of fun but i think it can improve
Please reinstall
Awesome game
Has a not a game because every player is haker
"This is a very good blast from the past! This is good I won't deny it. But I liked it more when it had the D pad, I tried to spin dash away from a incoming projectile but the joystick registered it as jumping so I jumped into it and since I had no rings and 1 life, I died and got a game over. Please go back to the D pad as the joystick isn't reliable"
The game is known for its movement god level

Worst ever
Good game
Good
Used to be really cool cause you could join other people's worlds but for whatever reason they got rid of it
Good game to play
This game is rubbish when it comes to matching players and the mechanics of the game in h2h. The players respond so slow to the controls. It's not even funny at this point
Good
"Just wow,the creator of this game is the best"

Ugh fix the ping for my a11 I can't play it anymore:(edit: btw the lag/ping was bad I will give 4-5☆ edit: galaxy a11 phone I have and it's still laggy as hell and I'm using a network so plz fix the issue thxs and I tried the low mode and it still lagged on me I'm rank 11 btw and btw username is Gabe2000steen if you need the username to fix it edit: k I hope I can play this great game again
"EDIT: the issue seems to be fixed. It happened the worst in junon. But got better after a restart. There are still a few glitches,but nothing bad at all. Issue was likely on my end (galaxy s10)Black polygons all over. Text unreadable. glitchy, unplayable frequently. I was going to just emulate it, but figued I'd pay to support the developers. Regretting that desicion.I would have reached out to the Devs, but I can't find a way to do that,so I'm going to assume im stuck with an unplayable game."
"Great game, just wish I could import from the original for my cars."
Outfit7 Tiny rails then temple run 2 become my talking Tom friends
I don't know what to say it's amazing even though it needs 544 mili bytes and I've clear 4 gigabytes and no redownload.
It's feel like you playing a gundam game
its nice
Still playing this wondeful game. There should be option to exit the current match. I am playing Clash Royale since last 3+ years.
Ads are bad and suck I hate ad
great game still addicted to playing this game yet it never gets old
Love the game but it's giving a pay to win vibe
It's fun
Hey Riot care to explain why we got the same enemy team 3 times in a row? And whats worse it's on rank game.
This is a very very nice game 👍
Good
It's good

Good game

es buenisimo muchos modos el modo zombis esta buenisimo peor falta optimizacion ya se notan los tirones de fps
"Once, a great game. But the game that was, has been updated to a cheap copy. Used to make it to 20k points and now the game feels like its trying to make you lose. Doesn't sound like a bad thing, right? The game is meant to be hard and a challenge? It simply does not feel like the game I found long ago. Also don't get me started on daily challenges now. Finally decided to uninstall and put it to rest"
Best game
"What's everyone's high score? Mines 10320. For the people that make this game, could you incorporate a score board of people playing the game? Please. I have spent literally years playing this, thousands of hours lol. My new high score is 17,921. Update as of 10/26/22 - Uninstalled this game because I was playing it too much. Reinstalled recently and with the update it's not the same. The developers should have an option to have both the old version and the new one."
love this game so much.also surprised i restarted from the beginning.there are lots of minigames...
"I am currently playing this game,but for about two weeks now,I have not been able to do much,as I keep getting told ,,it is updating. For goodness sake,how long does it take to update!!?? 27 March 2023. I am still waiting for the game to update ,so I can start a new area. Once it was 44% updated,then it went back to 0%. I have tried the help group,but no luck there. I even left a message.😡😡😭😭🤔🤔🤔"
Having synchronizing problem after updating.
Actually not a bad game. But I would give it a 3. The actual one is better.
"Why remains stuck 150 Level refused to go nxt stage frm Lin Kuei Tower no matter how tried,,Frust"
Nice game
It's awesome when I got it I spent 10$ 5stars but I hope in the future there are a few coll free add-ons like more pickaxes but aver all 5-5
nice game im playing this game for 6 years
Good
The games good and all. I like to play all day long. Regular updates and so on but there is a really annoying bug that happens when I'm playing. It happens frequently when I press play sometimes the whole game is closed and when I try to log in again is says brawl stars has temporarily stopped working. Happens alot Please fix this. Overall the game is awesome would have rated 5 stars ⭐if not for this bug.
"great game, I used to play it on my laptop 6 years ago, but now I play it on my phone"
amazing
Good
Annoying
Amazing fun game
Thank you! for fixing cloud save
High quality
Should put in a battle royale like cod mobile or pubg then this game could definitely be a 5 star I've been playing it for years and every time I download it nothing has changed.
Good game I have sonic two also and other game And I beat the game and got tails but there's a bug in starlight zone on zone 3 if you hit the red spring at the beginning of the level it crashes the game even if you don't move pls fix this
mfmaruf
It's fun and it gets you up and moving but there a lot of things that need changing or just put back into place.
"I accidentaly overwrote a new account over the main one, can i somehow get the old account back, pls respond!!"
This is very super duper game
Auto aim and auto shooting in shooter game. Stupidest idea.
Game is amazing but we just tried to do a Thunderus raid and it kicked us out now we can't get back in the raid since it just keeps loading doing nothing.
"I played 1010 nearly every day, until we purchased new desk top computers a couple of months ago. I have not been able to even install the same edition of 1010 since then. I tried to install, but there several other editions out there. I dislike any and all of them. I just recently was able to get the original version on my phone, but I really enjoyed playing the game on my monitor."
Just 👍👍😊
Worst
It's good I a good game I have a blast with my kids.
Good
"NOT HIGHLY OPTIMIZED, Need some major improvement in optimization, laggy game and server."
Love it
One of my favorites 😍
Bad
Mind that older review I made. That was my brother. But in my opinion the game is a great recreation of the older games with nice quality of life features that honestly make it more fun to play. I obviously can't critique it as if it were made today. So I'll review it on how fun it is.
Waste game it grow vengance for kids why I gave one star means I releif stress for that only very worst
Best game ever
Very nice game. I love it 💓
It monopoly alright
Rubbish app. Can't even register a new account.
COOOOLLLLLLLL
Game uninstalled itself after updating.
"I play this, i dont know what is happening in the game becoz the game dont show the how to control the player just showing the some special attack info"
This game is very good 👍 👌
Really fun
I ♥️ IT!!!!
not up to date and cant long in or sign up
Great game exciting. Super great
Good game
"I like this game as graphics are next level and you feel like they you are playing on a hig end gaming pc. But the only problem was that this game has too much voices and the characters keep speay all the time so, sometimes it becomes a little bit irritating so I think you should improve this. Thanks I like the game. Piyush Raut"
Great
easy to play and it keeps getting better and better when your playing
No longer the same.. not accurate in Location.. Not like they used to
"Awesome game! But the downfall is the game keeps crashing! It's so annoying when you're winning and on a roll especially when you're playing online multiplayer, then the game decides to just blackout!!"
It is better
I love and the updates but sometimes the marketplace doesn't work or when I want to play it doesn't work and I want to make potion of night vision there's no recipe for it so I really I hope fix the bugs bye Love Darcy I wish I could write the review in cursive
I like This fruit ninja game
Nice
Garbage
bruhh
Nice game 👍
Good graphics good fps good missions the game is good
"I don't have the words 2 explain how awesome this game is, 5 stars all the way"
"Good game Graphic is good, good attitude good approach personally I like it"
Really good game and good characters and also you can choose what language you want and also you can put the voices Japanese and the words English
This game was very best game in the world
"This app was my favorite of all time I had 10,000 as a high score. I paid for ad free gaming experience and you make me still watch ads, deleted my high score, and now the game keeps crashing no matter what I do. I love this app but I may go find one that's not a money grab that's rigged for you to watch more ads then you play. I recommend the older version of this app but now I would not recommend this at all. I am sorry but please fix it. If I paid for ad free gaming it should remain that way."
Didn't like new update.only problem is bot lobby all the time on erangel.plz disable this bot lobby.make old time players combat game.
Awesome
I lost my account but this game is lit🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cant create account unless you use a chinese number
It is great to know people who are playing getting robux and making enjoyable worlds

لماذا لا يوجد مبدأ الهجمه الاخيره من المفترض أن عندما نكون قريبين من المرمي قليلا لا يمكن للحكم إنهاء المباراه لا كن عندما اكون منفرد مع حارس الخصم و ساسجل هدف يتم إنهاء المباراه و في مره كنت قد سددت و في لحظه دخول الكره في المرمه انتهي الوقت كيف هاذا. وايضا يوجد اخطاء كثيره لاكني سأكتفي بهذا القدر و اتمني تصحيح ذلك الخطئ الفادح و باقي الأخطاء الأخري و شكرا.
BUGGY! The blocks are not responding well when I move them. I had to clear cache everytime but to no avail. Please fix this

Add a Halloween skin please
I enjoy playing Farm Heroes when I am bored It is very important I love it🥰❤
Hasseb
Gets you out of house and is fun
"Fun, balanced and nice to play!"
"Not enough storage space error, I have a memory card this is another error...smh can't even enjoy this game always something"
Cool
no ads so far awesome
Game is quite entertaining!! But requires too much money to be spent in order to compete! The Game is quite unfair at times in terms of rewarding the grind! I've spent 30-40 dollars in the last week to acquire Gold keys to purchase necessary vehicles for an event with no luck. Its as though they want you to become addicted to the game until you're compelled to spend money just to keep playing. Support team is pretty cool though they try to do what they can to resolve issues so shoutout to them!
nice
Super game
Good so far
When FC Mobile will come
The best war game on mobile phone ... I love the zombie as well ...
Your game whole fun keeps freezing. I have updated and everything. Sit an hour into a game to only have it freeze is a waste of time for me and the other players. Please FIX it.
Nice experience
Osm
Have too much lag in new update
"Too bothering advertise, even you never can close until game want"
Fortnite is awesome
I got the first chaos emerald
Still enjoying
Love the game
I like game Vvsbnnsjjhdvbebwnbd Gaghbnenb hba sb yaad bsh w Hbe nkna he will w Nnanns
This game really sucks. It used to be my favourite game but not anymore. Everything in this game is all about headshot headshot headshot.
Cant update to latest version from playstore so cant register an account. This app is total rubbish
"This game is super nice, and it's not super hard to play. I started yesterday and got 6 1st places in a row, and this game is incredible"
SONIC FAN
Watch to be hero x
Good game for kids
This game is just as good on mobile as it is on PC (or whatever device you play on) it's really fun and for all of you Minecraft lovers out there that's wanting to create and play on the road this game is 100% for you
"rag doll game that feels like a old flash game Full of ads, no way in hell is this game worth 40$ a month"
Takes up entirely too much space on your telephone slowing it down and today wants me to update with a huge file. This game isn't worth it so UNINSTALLED
I love it!👌
This game is sooooo fun I love it
season 3 Update so good CoDM 👍 🇮🇳
Enjoying the game
This game is so good 🔥
"It is bad version, old version is best update, and I have 5 star, and new version 1 star, very bad 👎👎👎👎 and all time is difficult team player very very bad 😞😞😞"
Good game
Awesome game! Love it just the people on there are sometimes very toxic
This is cool game
It's fine just very laggy and my friend can't invite me even though there account is connected
Yo are there ads in Roblox now cuz I JUST GOT A DAMN ADD And btw I ain't playin Roblox ever again my life cuz there are bugs lags gliches in games and I can nearly play a single game cuz it's too laggy and like every single game on Roblox FREEZES
wow
I consider removing the bonus level thing
Awesome 👍
Good
This game is really amazing but I still don't have mui goku Plz give me mui goku
Nice game 🎮
The game is good and can be pretty fun to play with friends. One problem I have is all the changes. Getting rid of the boxes was a horrible move and unlocking characters is really hard now. Boxes were also full of surprise too and you could unlock alot of things that you know have to buy. Overall good game but I dont like the new layout and features.
Great game. Though the updates can be a big cut in your data
its is a really good game and I enjoy playing it but it becomes way too laggy online
The besttttttt
Well made game. Nostolgia galor!
Worst
"Such a laughable attempt at Singleplayer. Easy is too easy, medium is more difficult & hard is rooted. The only increase in difficulty is the game giving you bad rolls and the AI extraordinary rolls. After playing 3 hard games to confirm my hypothesis, I was proven right. As soon as I had any edge on the AI, it screwed me over. I bankrupt 1 bot, and from then on, I landed on jail (no rent in jail rule) or their property every lap of the board. They did not land on mine once. Disappointing"
"Just keep getting a black screen with ""Unable to initialize the Unity engine"""
I love football ⚽⚽
Nice game
The game is great fun and runs pretty good sometimes it'll just kick me off but that's normal with my phone it would be helpful if you can send me some gold or money to help out I am in a struggling position where I can't win a single race!!!
"The game uses extraordinary long and oftentimes completely inappropriate ads(not family friendly, lying and so on) to generate revenue."
🤎
"I love this game ever since I got this app I couldn't stop playing it, is pretty awesome if you ask me! I think u can add more things to the game to make it even better!😉"
5 🌟 nice 👍
Ok mam
It used to be a fun game. After a year or so I started playing again and they make you watch an ad to rotate a piece which is absurd.
Game very addictive love it keeps me occupied.
"Can't install it on my Poco X3 phone. After 100%, it said can't install. It not about line and phone memory. My phone has enough free space and my wifi line are good"
It is my number one game.But can u give me bucks if it's possible
Vicans-14
It's good the graphics is good and a very smood controle i love it but when u first play it ur VS bots for a long time which makes me kinda mad cuz it's easy but the bigger rank u get the harder it gets and u go VS real players so ye after all its good. I would give it 5 stars If they would add more free rewards in the BR pass cu it like 2 free stuf per 5-7 tiers so that's kinda all I never had any issue so te game is very good. Thanks for the hard work u guys put in the game!
Ronaldo goat but messi not goat
This game is incredible it's like a game in in thousands of games
"When i try to download this game,after it reaches 100% its says the game cannot be downloaded. I hope you all to see this problem and fix this problem"
not bad
Thanku
Superb
"Hi,the game has issu becous i wes in level 44 after playing 4 weeks then a pass the level but they level up me into level 44 back why,Free Fire pleas i am asking you becaus my freands are in level 49 when i try to level up 45 they yeled at to me,pleas level up me into 45 pleassssssss"
"I had this game it is so fun ,but now when I download it again I can't load my account although my account is on my email 😔 please help me"
"I love the game, even tho I play on a potato phone that laggs its still fun to play"
Sonic is the best
Too many ads
Amezing
it acutally fun man this game is good
good
Very easy game
I really love this game. But after an update i cant play anymore all its do is showing me a loading bar.
Lots of fun
Bad losers ruin it. People get angry that you refuse trades or that they are losing and stall the game by viewing and reviewing properties so their turn won't time out. There is no safeguard against this kind of behavior and it ruins the game.
Fun game
Downloaded tryout ended up playing for hours straight awesome RPG hooked already
This is so hard but i love it geat work to creator 😎😋😊
BMG is good game but I request of the devoloper plss make PvP tournament and choose 100 best pvper in this game

I love the game 🎮
My game automatically deleted
Good

Five year old son loves playing this game.
QQ is not international
This game is fun

I gave it 4 star because it starts you off a bit hard.
"Why can't these games EVER be as advertised??? This is a standard Match 3 game and NOT at all like the fun of the advertisement! No pull the pin, no escaping danger type things at all. Very disappointed."
"This is a paid game, yet they have worse multiplayer connecting issues than free to play games. Like seriously I have perfect internet but when I try to join my friend I'm stuck on ""locating server"" indefinitely. Yet my friend is able to join me on my worlds. I just can't join other players unless it's on the public servers like lifeboat."
cute game
Nice game
This game to much on getting skins or pilot or mecha gotta actually spent big money just to get good stuff crazy game crapy dunno that I stop playing it for like 4 months
"I think normal players shouldn't put up against the VIP players in duels , it ain't fair. They're too overpowering"
I've been playing since 2019 then comeback in 2020 I was playing a game I think it was called weight lifting simulator 3 in 2019 when I downloaded roblox. I found the game wl3 boring and deleted roblox 😂
World best game
My Childhood.🙃💟💫
"I've been playing this since it first came out and I've never had a problem until recently. I don't know if it's a recent update that is causing the problem or if it's my new phone. I am no longer receiving any of my notifications. I have made sure I have given the app permission to send them to me. I have not had the same issue with any of the other games I have switched to playing on this phone. I hope it works soon. For now, I don't know if I'm being invited to raids."
"Something wrong with this update .. i want continue the game that i save on facebook , but sadly it say i need to update first if i want to play .. the problem is when i go to playstore there's no update button .. how can i update and how i can play if i can't update 😭"
So funny now
"It's a very good game but If u gonna play on mobile play on a tablet u get a better view of the game and more stuff put if u really want the best version of roblox play on pc or controller because u get more buttons, because I was playing a game and pc players had more buttons so make ur u play on pc buts it's ur choice this game has alot of goofy ah people to"
This is funny
I realy like it good grafic
Goku
Fun
"Too bothering advertise, even you never can close until game want"
I love it so much
Close as you're going to get your console version of dragon Ball z
This used to be my favorite game and it is still 😅
"Feel pretty much scammed. Opening fmv has music, soon as gameplay begins there's no music. Tried to get a refund and google says no of course. Sad to see such a classic treated this way. Hopefully SE can eventually be bothered to fix it."
"The game needs new updates: improving the stability of the game, such as animation, movement, the quality of internet servers, saving data, progress, and thank you for responding to the opinions of players."
faltu ghatiya purana game
This app keeps me busy I love it
Yay
I like it
great game
Nice game
Nice post thanks for the first time play
Love this game as an Anime Fan this game brings me the joy that it Dragon Ball/Z/GT and Super in the palm of my hands
It is gud
My favorite game ever ❤️
I love this gamw
Este juego es muy jenial me divierte más que nada
Nice game
"Minecraft? It's a game that limitless create but the limit is your imagination,the game is to build a house attack a monster avoid danger and tarvel new demention the game is over 3 million download and Mojang will promise that they will infdev for you"
This game is nice I'm enjoying this game this intresting and endless game I'm proud of this game

I like this game
"Crazy bugs. Please fix. Bad control, and can trapped into underground, can not escape"
"Can you please fix the Sign in system for the microsoft account because we can't use a Wifi to do it. I get that sometimes you need to sign in again, but everytime I'm doing it its not gonna work unless im using a Cellular data and will never go through if your using a Wifi. Please fix this because I dont always have a cellular Data."
Don't waste your money on this retarded game
Gioco stupendo wowwwww
Best game
It is good
dont need this game when i have my wrist
Wonder fully
I love this game because it's just like GTA 5 mobile but older
Best game
It's great
Good
Worst experience ever. After new update it is not opening at all and 'wifi error' message poping out and although I have connected to wifi network the game data is not downloading and it makes the phone run slow(although I use a snapdragon 870) that if you want to close the game it is not closing and display touch sensor also not working.Fix this soon enough and update it.
Very good
I can't open it
Such a beautiful game and playing on good game more than refreshing the mind and playing well ❤️‍🩹
I describe dragon ball legends as masterpiece because everything done is perfect and it is hard work so i rate it 5/5
"I like it More and More, The rank and legendary Rank are even more exciting and thrilling. Challenged each Match About the hero, i would like the Couple hero to be adjusted, what I mean is Xayah and Rakan. Xayah's 2nd skill can put effects on Rakan's AA but for Rakan the only good for him is his Recall where they can recall together and that's that. I would like to adjust his 3rd skill to increase range(like the pc style) for a better use when they're together in the rift."
A Classic !
"This game is great, but the lack of important features makes it frustrating. For example, A player is stuck whenever they face an internet issue, and no one else can help but wait. I would request that you add a timer so that everyone doesn't have to wait whenever such a situation comes up. Also, a leaderboard could show the ranking of individual players globally or at least nation-wise. The ranking should be based on individual performance and the number of games one win or loses"
"Upgraded to ad free. Go to use power up, immediately thrown into an ad. Reinstall to see if this was a bug. Same thing, and on top of that my stars (in game currency) as well as high score were rolled back over a weeks worth of playing. 0/1010, do not recommend."

Excellent game
Not able to connect my facebook account and google play account

"Worst game. Rigged matchmaking. I did an experiment. Built a deck only good against the 2.8 hog cycle. Haven't seen one since. 100% rigged don't play this game. If u do, dont give them you're money. Bad faith game makers."
i just really love this game it's super cool and just makes most of my day
Best game ever! I love you roblox you the best.
I used to like this game but I think I quit it used to be fun unitl I met dommlight the unbalanced mech battle royale me the hurricane vs doom light am like okay I got a chance to win he spawned mini turrets three or four they doing heavy damage start to fight back he spawned a sheild then after that it's just a combo break the sheild he spawns another shield and put turrets down again and he can shoot through the sheild so mind you he completely have the advantage horrible mech unbalanced
Wonderful
Good game
I have an error issue that don't make me play the game says [can't download asphalt 9 right now] I tierd tooo many times and getting the same error still happens Help
When you know that your game can't operate without wifi then should mention it that the user must have wifi connection. Then we would not be downloading it and having it on the phone for no reason. Game is not opening only.
I love it
My game makes me delite the game and down load it back to play

"I wish there was more to Monopoly than just your typical Monopoly. It would be nice if there were two different gameplay versions, similar to what Battleship has (the Marmalade one) which has Classic version and a Commander version. More creativity would make Monopoly much more fun."
It is good
"The game is good, but the one missing star is alot of hackers"
That very good
"Ads became more aggressive now. They pop up even if I don't want to see them. Cars bought with money are more powerful than earned. Not to mention it takes forever to get a car by playing. There are some bugs with the auto-drive, crashes the car for no reason. Have to wait 3 hours to play with the only car in higher class just once, then wait again 3 hours. Police cars; unbelievably strong, too powerful. Multiplayer car dividation sucks, can't use your best car to climb rank. Asphlt 8 was better"
Best game and graphics I play daily
Great.
Mast ✌🏼
I love this game this is a very fun game and you can lune by playing this game dream it build it best game i had love you mojan for minecraft

"I think this game is the best in the world.I love it!I hope there are more updates. Yea I don't know why, but since forever I can't join anyone and no one can join me. I don't get what the problem is."
Very Hard Game For F2p.. But Nice Game
I love this game but pay to get anything is just bad 😞 make me sad
OP
"Great concept. Would be great if PC emulators would be separate from mobile users. Alpha map is great. Origo map is glitchy and needs some work and it seems it requires more device memory which makes it difficult to play as there is lags and crashes, especially if other plays are emulating on PC. Whatever is making Origo hard to play, if removed, would make experience better, as many players seem to be facing same issues with Origo map. I wouldn't miss it if map was removed completely."
"Keep end up 1 vs 3, hoe you start a game putting in a team game, but i one person get in the game?? When all are 3??? Not once but 7/10 round!? For sure lose as a beginner . Refund i want my money back!! You can delete the account !!"
I like it they got good characters and equipment also the worlds r cool
"Do not play this game. The main reason I say this is lag. Impossible to get into a proper fight without being stuck in the same position for al least 10 seconds. No matter what phone you play on, you cant say the game hasn't given you lag problems. It really pisses me off. I have a really good loadout then lag. I'm there for so long. And then an opponent kills me. Happens EVERY TIME. Would not reccomend. Epic, fix your game."
Well it's very blocky which I like! But it may be too much like Minecraft.
Great experience good people
Love temple run
"Is a good game and all but I'm missing multiple of my character cards assassin kitana, classic liu Kang, hellspawn scorpion, cold war scorpion and subzero, circle of shadow liu Kang, all the day of the dead characters, ravenous and vampires mileena, classic scorpion and sun zero, strike force scorpion, shoals Kahn from completing the tower, black dragon erron black and classic jade and mk 11 jade I had all these cards before the gold and diamond exchange and when I got back on they were gone"

I would like to invest in your game.
Mechs were trash
Cool game really fun
Worst game ever the boxes r better than the credit plss include boxes in game as previously
This is the game!
It was better before the new update now it's just boring to play and get new brawlers. The boxes were better.
Shafted again!!!
Aws
The best experienced game ever played by myself. That's why I have raten this game 5star rates.
So the game is fine. Here is the real issue. The dice algorithm is complete trash. I tested this over 20+ games. You land on go to jail an unusual amount of time. On several games it took over 10 tries to make it all the way around the board and pass GO. Almost always land on go to jail. I actually can't play and enjoy the game because I am in jail almost every turn. Graphics and animations are nice and the menu is simple. So I gave 2 stars for that reason.
Main gareeb hoon Beijing Corn
Falae advertisement saying 100 free summons.
It's a game
Great game
Dis is good game is Roblox ban scammers and hackers pls
Lagging and pink game
Fine. But the summon in the game is totally waste as instead of the character with higher percentage rate does not appear but the hero units with less percent appears again and again. Summon sucks but Gameplay rocks.
Great game with fantastic graphics

One of the best games

My Gameworld always gets deleted!!!!! I want a refund
Controls are terrible. Buttons are in odd places and the four directional buttons don't work. No optim for me to adjust them. I assume it doesn't support the resolution of my Samsung s22 ultra.
GAME IS ORJINAL
"So far the best mobile game ever played. Kinda addicted to it now. Though the game is very big in size its worth. I just love and even my squad loves it alot. Its been almost 3 years since i started playin this game but never got bored of it. The graphics, controls, adjustable sensitivity, soo many modes and maps are also really awesome. But in global version they need to give some free legendary guns to the players as ut costs alot and for many of them itd unaffordable. ..."
Best mobile game ever! Just a beauty of a game.
Super
This game is legendary but I hate the fact that I'm spending over 20000cc on this game just to get ultra Goku black
Fun to play when playing with friends
I lost my account :(

The best game ever
"It was probably my favorite game back in 2018, but now I see no one playing the og games that a lot of og players used to play. I feel pretty old just looking back at how much the community grown after these past year. I'm pretty sad I did lose my rich account but then again I wouldn't be playing this game now or somewhere in the future but it was fun playing this game and being able to paly with friends. I only wished to meet them in real life so we could communicate more. Thank you blockman go"

How has this not been updated. Btw as of right now I can maybe join a game 10% of the time otherwise it just freezes or loads your char. Solo. Edit: this game is BEGGING FOR A DECENT UPGRADE. PLEASE FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT
This is very nice game 👍
Enjoy to play in your free time
"This game is very good. It allows you to build your creations, play with other people and socialise and more! It's a great game for my children. With the new exciting updates, I can ensure that my children could play."
i like pubg mobile
It is a nice game
nice
It good
PUBG siuuu
it wont update ‼️
"If you're looking to start or return to the game, don't bother. They just launched a terrible update that nerfed both F2P and those who buy the pass (while raising the price) and are also adding a new card level which will make the game more P2W. They also clearly don't listen to the community. Find a better game, this is a sinking ship."
Its the best game once you get a hang of it like you could really really get a nice fun 15 games out of this and you'll like it if you just grind and put in the effort you would make this game your favorite
30 sec advertising...no thank you

"Not gonna talk about the game itself here, I instead want to focus on this game as a port (OG game's a 4/5 by the way). This port is amazing. The controls are smooth as butter and it even runs on 60fps! The physics were also tweaked upon for smoother gameplay and it's stellar. The smootherSpecial Stages, widescreen, new characters-- truly incredible port. Good job to everyone in the team."
The best dragon Ball game but there are some bugs in low hand devices

I like all generation that have been released so far in the game can't wait all the shiny Pokémon to introduce. can't wait for more mons introduce especially the new megas"

IT IS SO GOOD GAME 💯👍
This game is very good but you give 1time gcubs plz
"A very high quality gacha game imo with a good story and nice character designs. The animations for the ultimates are also incredibly well done.The rates for 5 stars is also incredible however you do need to get a few copies of each 5 star to make it mid to late game viable. With all of this considered, i would defenitley reccomend this game to anyone looking for a new gacha title."
good keep up the work. 😄
Very fast

"Amazing game. Ads get annoying so 4 stars for that, but other than that its great. Would totally recommend."
Roblox Is very fun I love it but the only thing I hate about roblox Is the removal of so many audios I miss Rick rolling people I miss playing my favorite star wars tunes but now there gone roblox please bring them back
Ilove it
"Good game, definitely not optimised for low end devices, even tho my phone runs smoothly with every other game, it lags whenever I play codm, the internet issue still isn't fixed, request timeout bug still isn't fixed, p2w players keep increasing, f2p players decrease, so does their chance of winning. Lots of bugs, keep increasing, no good free rewards. Deserves 5 stars but still has a long way to go till it reaches 5 stars."
Best game so far

Amazing game

"No ads, graphics just like playin on console I'm playin on max graphics with shadows without a actual gamin phone it doesn't lag at all but the map doesn't work for controller but u can use ur touchscreen to help with that other then that 5/5"

Me encanta puedes consigir ahora con la actualización que tengo es mejor y personajes gratis si todo fuera gratis oooo dios mio sería el mejor free fire
"This game is great, but the lack of important features makes it frustrating. For example, A player is stuck whenever they face an internet issue, and no one else can help but wait.

Also, a leaderboard could show the ranking of individual players globally or at least nation-wise. The ranking should be based on individual performance and the number of games one win or loses"

لماذا لا يوجد مبدأ الهجمه الاخيره من المفترض أن عندما نكون قريبين من المرمي قليلا لا يمكن للحكم إنهاء المباراه لا كن عندما اكون منفرد مع حارس الخصم و ساسجل هدف يتم إنهاء المباراه و في مره كنت قد سددت و في لحظه دخول الكره في المرمه انتهي الوقت كيف هاذا. وايضا يوجد اخطاء كثيره لاكني سأكتفي بهذا القدر و اتمني تصحيح ذلك الخطئ الفادح و باقي الأخطاء الأخري و شكرا.

supper good game
Vicans-14
I paid for the ad free version and for the black theme a few years ago but one of the updates removed my access to the theme. Also all of the updates this past year have made the game so much worse and are obvious cash grabs
"Don't buy this on mobile, poorly optimized, clunky unresponsive controls and poor framrate/random frame drops damn near make the game unplayable. I can't accurately stepcount, reliably set up skips or do certain other things needed for speedrunning because this runs so badly on mobile which is a big time deal breaker."
I love this game
Besttt game!!!!
Bad game ever
It's great
It's AWESOME!!
"It's Sonic for the phone, what else is there to say! It plays well and looks great, just like it did back in the day. You do have to pay for the full game eventually though but it's worth it if you like Sonic."
Good
"Add battle pass and better shooting input in pvp. Using my Razer Kishi sucks as I try to trace and shoot. The bullets have a delay. If you want more money add battle pass for premium weapons, armor, and skins. Update your tweets. That's how most gamers find out about game updates."
I love

This is the best game ever! I love it and it works great. But I only have one problem that on computer can you put back the old version the one for mobile is now on computer we need the original back
It's a good game and I will play . It's fun
I literally play for the score ..does anyone else not have background music?? ..I played the original and was looking forward to the music with Cloud and Tifa's flashback... . ..and nada.. I'm on android chromebook.

Best time pass

"Best game I've ever played, Battle Royale is my skill in surviving as a player I hope more of this... Mechs in your system like the one I use with a sword, it's fun and I enjoy playing this game."
"Few things... Laggy, has you watch ads for extra exp but rarely awards it, sometimes you find a chest but you can't open it, prices for items are stupid greedy, maps are tiny and look the same, character customization is super limited, all your items are stuck together in the same bag, there's no way to separate what you want to hang on to and what you want to sell, constant coverage of the screen with messages with no way to turn it off. Could've been super good..."
Awesome
Wonderful
One of the best games ever Played
Game became p2w
"Man, I wish I could go lower. The sheer amount of just ad after ad is bull@#%*. If you see this devs, just please stop with the forced ads. And I am NOT the only one with this same opinion. So just please get better. Same with Jetpack Joyride."
Good game
I like mobile adventure just make more update
"I love this game but I hate the New Stone Block. It is unbreakbale which destroys the point of blocks. It makes it to where if you are playing Duels, instead of people fighting to progress the game, they hide and get easy wins. It is the most shallow thing and the game would be better if it was taken out."
The game as a whole is awesome. But it's a huge game with a butt load of updates constantly. Last few updates made my mecha not want to turn. I get blown up before my mecha has a chance to move.
Classic. I love it
OP GAME
Fun
Just because
Went from barely tolerable to utter garbage. I don't know what they were thinking with this new update but it was enough for me to finally walk away.
Very fun game! Sucks that you have to buy other things on it once you purchase it already but it's still very fun.
Just like I remember
Experience is good. Please join bike racing mode in game😍
"Just updated this stupid app and I'm still getting under maintenance, what the hell ever that's bs, changing the time to undecided for maintenance completion. That's enough to completely change my 5 star review to a 1, I'd give it less if I could. Make up your mind stop changing the expected update time. Review will stay as long as this keeps happening."
无法下载最新版本
i have reated this before and i haved give 5 stars since the new update came it says 50 ping but my game is with no internet before the update the game was very good i hope yo make it better
"Beautiful, Exciting and Engaging. CSR 2 has it all, and it doesn't hesitate to prove it! The graphics and art style are top notch, and the customization is so satisfying too! The story keeps the campaign interesting, but it isn't anything too extreme. A solid 9/10 and recommended for all racing fans! Shy out of 1 point due to the very chunky data usage and overheating of even the best phones... don't play if you have a weak phone..."
ΑΧΡΙΣΤΟ ΔΕΝ ΣΕ ΑΦΗΝΕΙ ΝΑ ΠΕΖΕΙΣ ΜΕ ΦΙΛΟΥΣ ΤΑ ΑΛΛΑ ΟΜΩΣ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΚΑΛΑ ΘΑ ΒΑΛΩ 2 ΑΣΤΕΡΑΚΙΑ
I enjoy this game its so fun and great to go out walking and explore
The game is fun but it keeps on kicking me out I've really get internet so most likely it's the app or more than likely should I say
"Absolutely love it, brings back memories. Nothing much about it changed, unlike other games. I understand it benefits you, but maybe you could limit the amount of ads?"
Super
Worst matchmaking at all
Cool game
Good and very good and slways mood be fresh ho jata ye game khel na ke bad .
"Hello, E sports and Fifa developer people please refine your servers, it's a lot more boring to play the even though the game is too good to play but due to the issues of connecting to server and loading symbol for almost around 20 seconds occuring even under 300MBPS speed data I'm not feelinhlg to play the game. Also if the problem exists more i will uninstall the game"
too difficult but cool dudes
"Facing serious issues in h2h matches, full of lags , connection issues and even my squad completely changed while entering a h2h match (happened twice in one week)"
The game is good
"Very fun game, Love 💕💕 it."

"Would be a 5 star if I got at least 50 coins for each pokemon in different gyms. Should get 50 per pokemon, not 50 a day and that's it."
Good
Cool
The game is best but we need rank in arena and the title of arena master so plz focus on arena rank in next update.

The game is very nice and cool to play.
PUBG siuuu
Trip game
No one can trust this game.this is delicious 😋 game
Mechs are cool. The gameplay is ok. Whoever spent so much time on the art for the cash grab stuff tho needs a real job.
Will not install anymore due to the additional data
Very intertaining game
Waste game
Best moba game ever. But matchmaking take a long time to load.
Amazing
John Io too booby and I will be there for
If this game was not so hard I would have given it 4 stars
"Very fun and enterainin! Ok played for awhile now, I must admit watching ads is sooo boring..in this game you must watch a vidio to clam your daily prize, and a vidio for your extra goodies , and a vidio for anything you come up in game ..so the small amount of fun is over shadowed by the amount of time you must invest in watching ads to get goodies...Im out..."
Great game

"I am loving playing this game on my mobile phone. My only issue is I am not able to use Phoenix Down. It targets to alive characters instead of the KOd characters. Is anyone else having this issue? Also, when cloud is on the motorcycle escaping Shinra, the speed is crazy fast, almost unplayable."
"The most useless app i have ever used, i cant even registered if there was possible for a 0 i would rate it 0 but since i cant im giving it 1"
i like this game just do 2 part of ricky RAT
Good
I love the game and all its a great game but the problem I wanna tell u guys that the network is not right I'm now gonna explain If I shoot my enemy's maybe headshots or like normal shots then it show afterwards that I shot him down thats what is happening in cs rank its slower Can u please fix that Great game by the way😏📌❤
"Everytime i tap on a pokemon to catch it, the screen goes white and doesnt start the battle. Ive already tried resetting it. Will update when fixed"

Still Fun!
I love this game there's alot to do but for some reason my legends double relay isn't working
"Game requires too much skill, too many controla to master, the difficulty settings is not for average humans, but the settings and effects are great for young children"
My favorite game I like a tample run 2😉
Great game but we need turbo building!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nhhfcniy
I hate it!! I hate the update plss fix the loading screen I have been stuck in the loading screen for no reason or in other words this update is buggy
It's a great game until you realise you can only get to level 27 no matter how long you play. There is 4 worlds but only 3 are available. I've messaged the development team and they have no plans on opening the 4th world anytime soon. It's become very boring
I love it
QQ is not international
"I have a lot of problems with this game. It's a good game, I like the graphics, characters and so on, but this game lags and crashes. I hope you can fix it🙏♥️."
This game is good
"Very Good game,Good grafics,Good Quality,Except When it kicks you every 3 minutes no matter how much storage space you have.This Needs to be Fixed."
very good game specially the skyblock
ABSOLUTELY W**K!!!!! DO NOT AND I MEAN DO NOT DOWNLOAD YOU'LL BE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON THIS GAME THAN IN YOU'LL SPEND IN YOUR LIFE TIME!!!!!!!!!

Nice
Its good game install it if the game not work re download it
I liked it but in the ads and on the pics showing stuff you can do you can't do like anything that they say you can in the ads. It's annoying 😒
Bad game
Learà
Great .
Wiiiiiii
"Pretty fun, but needs improvements. There are no experience points or record keeping for playing the single person game. I would like to see game stats and easier comparison to other players. Also, the game glitches frequently. Number of moves does not equal dice roll and moves do not match Chance card ( Advance to Go put me on Baltic.) Not a glitch, but when I must sell assets, it does it instantly. For other players, I have to wait between each transaction. Very slow. I liked it enough to pay."
Nice game
Clasic 👌
"Definitely rigged. Either devs are not aware that they are unintentionally rigging the dice numbers or are secretly laughing at the poor saps who thinks this is fair. Try explaining double roll for three bots at a consecutive time while I get double taxed, hit with specific number to be moving to a worst place possible, every. Single. Time. hmm? Go ahead, I'm waiting for your statistical explanation."
nice
Please Redius troops training time.
brilliant game love it
Idk what to say..
"Minecraft? It's a game that limitless create but the limit is your imagination,the game is to build a house attack a monster avoid danger and tarvel new demention the game is over 3 million download and Mojang will promise that they will infdev for you"
Surge protector
"This is a very good game One problem though,I sometimes quit the game in the middle of the room and then like usual,I got put back a room with all monsters killed but suddenly I took the damage that I took in the next room even though I quit the game in the middle of fighting the monsters"
"I just had this problem. So I tried tomake a tsunami in a command block with a /execute command. But it doesn't seem to work, although it works in the past."
Good
Love this game as an Anime Fan this game brings me the joy that it Dragon Ball/Z/GT and Super in the palm of my hands
"Fix the Origo island map. It's so difficult competing with other players cause there are alot of glitchs there. As a player who spends money on this game, it gets on my nerves. So please fix it."
Excellent game
Amazing fun
"Excuse my word, but fcukyou gardens Cape. Ok. This is the only game I love to play,and I already reach 12000+level, some super hard level is super hard to win, but atleast when we tried about an hour I can completed. But this morning cannot win no matter how many time I try even spend all my star to have live,??!!!!! What is wrong with you?!!?, I almost broke my phone because of you. And always notify me to buy live 😠 don't be too greedy"
Good
Fantastic 😊😍😊😍😊
"Fun and difficult game levels are broken up with quick, easy levels. Graphics are pretty."
It's good
1 word: AWSOOOOOMMMMEEEEEE
It's feel like you playing a gundam game
Very very fun
SUPERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
开不了新用户
Please add bioweapons
"Tiresome but awesome game , really would have played it but it doesn't go along smoothly and very mundane monotonic theme gets set"
"Worse AI game play. Dice rolls feel rigged, and odds always stacked against me. I finally get some hotels, and none of the opponents land on them. I could half the majority of the board and still end up bankrupt. Getting the opponents mortgaged property is terrible because we gain no money from them. This makes it easier to lose the game."
Superb 👌
Good
"Played first level, tried to collect rewards, couldn't. According to game I am not connected to internet, I have network error 7. Apart from that, can't even comment on game"
Good luck
Add bots it takes so long to get in a game
Nice
This is a pretty cool game i play it when im bored

"It is very beautiful, and I also played and created an email on it, and it is really wonderful, but the problem of the lag, I hope to solve it as soon as possible 😭❤"
good game
"amazing but please stop messing with the mech updates and stats its actually getting ridiculous how much the devs change how fast they move, health points, shield points, and even damage points."
GAME IS ORJINAL
Not good won't update
صعوبه كبيرة لتسجيل معقد لمذا كذا لم استطع التسجيل
Even though I never tried it I'm probably going to download it on time though it's so good though someone really really likes it and it's not my brother really likes it so I'm going to give you five stuff goodbye
Trash
"Great stuff. Truly enjoy playing, it's refreshing always"
I need help omg the app is glitching and I tried to uninstall and reinstall but it's still the same glitch page.
Good
I bet you will be boring after some days but those some days will be so fun
Great Game
NETWORK ISSUE DETECTED REALLY ?? CANT LOG IN NOW 😐
Very bad
Why is it so hard to sign up? 😑
Fruit Ninja
Very nice game
"Crashes frequently, particin the middle of online games. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling it and yet it still does it. It's really annoying and has been doing this for over a year now. When will they fix it."
AszA B R
Good
Entertaining

Gold bar event
Wrong description of the new update. C'mon simple tasks.
Not is bad but Not is good 🙂
I love this game... When I can get it sometimes I can get it into the game however lately within the last couple days I haven't even been able to sign on or get past the very intense of the game
I love this game
"Aw-ful. This game now SUCKS. You are forced to endure endless 30 second ads. Or, no ads at all in which case you can't advance at ALL. Ads. Ads, ads. Infuriating! And the ads FREEZE so when you try to go back you are told the ad was skipped and you have to start all over! It seems to get worse all the time. I wish I could give it a zero instead of a one! AWFUL GAME."
I love this game so much it is attractive and a game everybody should play👍🙂🙂
"If you're a fan of the original games, you will love Pokemon Go!"
I love this game. It's very fun to play. You should give it a shot 💫. The only thing is they pair you up with a high level player. Please fix the matchmaking. Overall it's great 😊. Edit: The game is not as fun as it used tbh =/. They're making the game more of a kids game now with every update which Im sad to see it changing 😔. It's hard to win nowadays because of players already max cards and such. I don't play as much nor I enjoy playing it as before =]. Please making it as before 🙏 😥💙.
"Just keep getting a black screen with ""Unable to initialize the Unity engine"""
Good
"I can't log in to supercell id,.. It's been 1 months waiting a verification code.. Im still not get it...!!!"
I literally play for the score ..does anyone else not have background music?? ..I played the original and was looking forward to the music with Cloud and Tifa's flashback... . ..and nada.. I'm on android chromebook.
Best graphical game you can experience!
"Ugh come on, my ping is too high on my server ASIA even my friends hated it that our connection is too poor fix this."
Christmas in our hearts
"I can't log in to supercell id,.. It's been 1 months waiting a verification code.. Im still not get it...!!!"
This game is very fun but I'm sad that you (team) took out the brawl boxes if you (team) can please add them back they were very fun
Excellent game

Good to play and just enjoy it
"Disappointed beyond words with the latest update. SuperCell got me with some of their cash grabs, but this newest one is insane. It took what little fun was left and took it behind the shed to put it out if it's misery. What a shame, this game used to be the best in the store, now it's easily in the bottom. Don't play the game, don't let yourself fall to the false hope of fun just to let SuperCell take your cash. SuperCell, do better. Remember back when you weren't all about greed? Me too..."
a'run'ku'ma'r
I lost my account :(
Interesting Game yaar
This game operates far too fast for me to keep up with 3 other computer generated players. Probably OK for younger players. Waste of money. Uninstalling this rubbish.
The app won't work. Keep asking to update but there is no update.
one of the best mobile game
Great game 😎😎
Nice
Have too much lag in new update
Best game
I really love this game but I'm stuck on a level that I can't seem to get through
It's is amazing
"Never trust a game that has a financial interest in your failure. Sooner rather than later it will force you into a corner and make you fail so it can earn money. This game does exactly that, by reducing randomness of the pieces it gives you to work with. After a while you have no choice but to lose and then they can offer to bail you out by forcing you to watch an ad. This game was a lot of fun about 5 years ago, much less so now."
Experience is good. Please join bike racing mode in game😍
This game is excellent.. Addictive game it is! But i enjoy the game.
Dqex
Nice
I have been asking for weeks to delete my save on the game but still nothing has happened and nobody has contacted me about it. Why write in help if nothing will be done. Still waiting and it's been over two weeks since I first asked. I have sent my ID and I don't think I had it reset before. I have been asking for two weeks now and still nothing
Prasanna Mankar
"If the free version is to attract people to buy the game, it surely fails its job. The ads are repetitive, out of place, and hinders gameplay even from the start. Simply terrible."

please someone tell me how to download this game in y smart tv m
The game was very nice game 🎮 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
why I can't downloading 🙂
Ridiculously too hard for progressing new players unless you spend money to get good things and most of the time theirs no guarantee you will get what you want completely hate how random everything is I would gladly pay for the characters I actually want instead of the game guessing for me
It's so fun :3---3
This is game cool and more cool
The game is really good the only problem with that is that it spam's you with microtransactions
Nail
Worst game Ever. I would travel to other countries outside my home country USA and i would travel to the certain ones when there would be a special event. Niantic would take it opon themselfs to bann me for cheating. i just don't get it i've been playing since Day 1' i was LV 50 and had every Pokémon. it just suxs!! Anybody eles had this issue as well.
This game will be perfect except the ads yes I know you need to make money but they're a bit tedious and also the game's not offline so you really need internet so they can give you ads which is werid.
Great ghraphics
"It's a very fun and strategical game and as long as you have more than 2 brain cells you will easily be able to overpower stronger opponents who are significantly higher level. If you see any of those 1 star reviews that say the game is too hard and pay to win just ignore them, the people who wrote them suffer from a medical condition called ""skill issue""."
"Graphics need upgrade, sometimes I cant even move my screen. Another problem is that it makes me crouch for no reason, then My screen is stuck like that"
Good enough
"Excuse my word, but fcukyou gardens Cape. Ok. This is the only game I love to play,and I already reach 12000+level, some super hard level is super hard to win, but atleast when we tried about an hour I can completed. But this morning cannot win no matter how many time I try even spend all my star to have live,??!!!!! What is wrong with you?!!?, I almost broke my phone because of you. And always notify me to buy live 😠 don't be too greedy"
"So this game is nostalgia central for me, so im biased on the story and such, but this port is kinda meh it runs fine on my s22. Controls are fine for me. Only gripe so far is the motorway escape, dear god, If u know this section, it's the same, but on crack. so be prepared for it at 4x the speed than ur used to."
4 star because sometimes the game keeps saying a communication has occurred please try again
This is my favourite game ever but I'm getting impatient now I have been trying to play ever since I downloaded it doesn't respond it just froze and the phone will get back to home screen automatically I'm so disappointed
Game is good but it lags during pvp battles. Please fix this issue.
This game is awesome....First you play it you feel good...👌
UPDATE: Looks like DEVS responded to my complaint - always a plus! Upgraded to 5 Stars! Highly addictive! No in game purchases needed to play. Not bombarded with ads!
This is the best game i ever play in my life.......
Nice game 🎮
Rajbharjiking0012

"Always something to enjoy whether it's ranked, events br or even playing with family and friends and 1v1. It lagged on my Samsung a53 5g but upgraded to Poco f4 gt and works awesome with highest graphics"
This is awesome game ever
Intrsting game bro
I bought the golden ticket. I can't see where I actually got anything for it? Very disappointed. Probably won't spend more money
Ssssssuuuuuuuppppppppeeeeeeerrrrr game extent
Very fast
Very expensive game. But good.
When FC Mobile will come
"there is no report, if member quit playing you play forever, just child playing this game, lol uninstall, dev dont care !"
"Yo, am super excited this proofs that the norrplay team really deal with problems when laid, well i had promised to review this and give a 5star rating if they could fix the problem i had and to my suprise it was fixed, kudos to you guys keep it up"
This got me addicted a soon as installed it 🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣
The game is great fun and runs pretty good sometimes it'll just kick me off but that's normal with my phone it would be helpful if you can send me some gold or money to help out I am in a struggling position where I can't win a single race!!!
"I love that game it's very fun and I enjoy it very much BUT... It could be a problem with me but it won't allow me to save,even though I cant save I'm still giving it 5 starts It's just that good of a game"
This looks a soo beautiful game but I can't open this game
Memorable
Extra Mind Blowing game
Game Alaiza
"It's an amazing game, it's glitching alot especially when I'm fighting in the top 10 or I'm firing at an enemy. Please 🙏🏽 can the glitches be fixed. The freezing got even worst after adjusting the graphics lower."
"there is no report, if member quit playing you play forever, just child playing this game, lol uninstall, dev dont care !"
this game is very good
"It is a really good game with great graphics great models and design of mechas and characters great skill effects and action effects it is a fair game because sometimes it's based on skills and experiences not in mechas the only reason this game has problem with is it's not so popular because it doesn't have an ad that can show how much potential this game has,this game has alot of potential doesn't have too many players playing this game but its fun"
I love this game a lot
v good game
Ben 10 characters should also
The new security is trash i cant log in to my acc because of the phone
Best game
Super game
Really fun
Good geam i like thanku so much
What is the reason for I give 1star the game was no optimize because when i play shodown and when the last enemy stands and i almost kill him the game was crash i know i have low end device mobile but you have to optimize the game for better experience
"Suggestion - When visiting farms for energy, there should not be anyone with zero eggs. Everyone should have at least one egg to be in the pool of farms that can be visited. People shouldn't have zero eggs on their own farm, but visiting other people's farms to mooch off of their energy. (In other words, visiting farms should be locked for anyone with zero eggs, and they have to plant at least one egg to participate. And anyone with eggs should never be forced to visit a farm with zero eggs)"
Amazing Game graphics

Amazing Game
"I really liked the game, but I'm having a problem. The game's sound has vanished, and it is really frustrating to play it without any sound sometimes, so I hope u guys can solve this problem for me"
Please give me a ultra man even after 30k spending non 😭
The best game ever
I find these ads abusive and totally offensive. They make a mockery of gender based cruelty and violence.
Nice
"Old time classic, wish it supported stratus xl controller natively. Works great on G Cloud max settings."
I love the game it is smooth 😎 👌
Good...
I LOVE SONIC ❤😃
"New , still figuring it out."
Wow

"What needs to be said about Minecraft that hasn't already been said? It's a timeless classic of the 21st century. As someone who has been playing ever since around 2012 to 2013, I absolutely recommend this game. While it's not the perfect game, it's still an amazing game nonetheless."
"I think it's pretty fun. It's much easier to play with friends and family on the app than the actual game. No math, counting, or space taken up by the large board. It can be hard to play a game all at once so it's nice you can pause games whenever, then take them out when you want to continue. The game also let's you play against a computer or other people, in case other people don't want to play. A clean and fun game!"
"so, cool game I am a football player I am very happy"

Not bad 😐
It would be good if you make easy to get souls.

Why did you delete the map that you make robots?and please bring back the boxes
Wish you would earn legend tokens for the cars you have purchased and trying to restore instead of cars that you are not currently trying to restore/have purchased. They make this game so you have to spend money.
Very good game only thing I can say is suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Nice game to play it brings you into the Pokémon World
ممتازة
Fantastic 😍😊
"Hands down graphically the best fps game also in tps . It's incomparable in terms of gun skins, character skins ,vehicles and special abilities in the name of classes . Even if you are a f2p , you won't be disappointed . If you are pro then you can get gun skins more easily . But this is a highly data consuming game . It's take about 30gb when you down all resorces ."
The game is interesting and impressive
Plz add argentina team 3 star jersey and logo and make this game like any device can easily play with 60 fps and ultra graphics dont show the issue and give the name change option pes mobile is better than it i will recommend you to play pes mobile

"Kindly launch Urdu or English version as well for us. Who do not understand Chinese language. Thank you. I am from Pakistan and want to use this app, But can't use because of language written in Chinese I don't understand."
Good game
It's five stars I'm to lazy to say more
"Nostalgic theme with a modern feel! Good for learning strategies. And to monopolize, I am a bit brutal in the game but I love it! Even when I don't win it's a fun time."

One of the best game in my life 😅😜 The best battle royale game I've ever downloaded in my (2GB RAM) device. Guys do checkout this battle royale game.The best game in the world 👍👍👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️♥️ -Best Game-.
"I loved the graphics ""very high"", ... But I want the creator to add slide button when running it's giving me chills by just thinking of it"
"I'd say this is the best mobile game currently, but there is this issue of loading screen timed out which is a little annoying. But overall it is a pretty good game"
"This game is just pure cool, with a cute little sonic and friends,He is ready to defeat Eggman!"
"love the game so so much, but recently I've been noticing it crashes a lot more then ever before. not sure if it's my phone or app that is the problem. I have a Motorola Stylus 5G and Cricket is my carrier. usually I can play whatever I want in the game except there will be a race or two that will crash immediately, but now it seems like everything crashes either just after the start or won't even act like it's going 2work. I found 1race that didn't just kick me today. 1 working all others crash"
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕I love this but I can't install it

To much advertising in this game
This game is better than BGMI I love it 😍😍😍

"Too many gacha games fail to find the balance between gameplay and lottery. This game reminds me of Epic Seven, another gacha to have excellent balance. Well done."
Nice game but some things that i don't like
Why won't this install everytime it gets to 100 it just stalls smh
We need a leader board challenges events
I love football ⚽⚽
"I love this game ♥️😊 Not only is this game a challenge, but, it is the most fun😊. Just be Awesome 💕"
Nice! This is a attractive game and this just for timepass and you can achieve the achievement and many more.
the new update doesn't have 2v2??

This game is so bad you have to destroy it with a bomb
so creative
Cannot install the update.
It's totally annoying that it takes days to be some levels and that you only give 5 trys at a time
good
Love playing this game
The ultra rarity is dumb and needs to be set higher for the summons. Many people have done countless summons for Ultra characters and never got them. Still a fantastic game though.
I like this game this so fun!! Play now
"The game is good ,the problem is that I have almost a week trying to update the game but it's still refuse"
Very good okkk
"Absolutely dogshit game, balancing and game play is WAY worse than lol pc."

Why is the samsung s pen not supported? I can only move blocks partially on the board.
まいかたけかさたまひ
I really like this game...it is fun and very enjoyable...helps in passing time....but the only thing I don't like about this game is that the leader doesn't have right to decide a new leader...
"I don't know how but this game is full of either scammers or bots, almost every game I play a player ends up giving up either all his properties for a few dollars or a single property that does nothing to help them, last game someone gave someone the final green space on the 4th side of the board for 15 dollars, no one would give you that for nothing in return, they player who recieved the money had plenty of cash, they got no properties in return and all the did was give other player a set"
fruit ninja game have a meaning
I like Pokemon and this game thank you so much developer for this game
Been playing for 6 years and update for losers is gonna absolutely kill the game. Sad to have to quit after the changes
I love it!
Best game dbl
Good game
Exellent
"After every game there's an ad, and it comes on the screen so fast its like being hit. It turns into a race to see how fast you can hit the back button so you don't have to look at the ad. The games not bad, otherwise. EDIT: and now they put up a stupid sad face if you lose and try to get you to pay to continue the game"
Mast
Is fun but glitches just ruins the game
Please update the game
in one day only it became my favaurate game thankyou gamemakers it is a good game
This game is amazing! I like to play this game in free time. But the reason i hit 4 stars because of bedwars. The people who are rich are overpowered and cannot be killed that means its so close to hacking. Please fix these. Anyways love the game keep it up.
"The game is great! Tip for everyone. Do NOT spend much money here for skins. There's no way to get your account back if you log off and you must link it with another social media platform. This game does NOT have it's own login platform. There's also NO way on getting support in regards to your game account. I have spent quite a lot of $$ for the skins. Logged out and now I'm fd. I have my username and password, but how would you login?? You can't ... So, be aware..."
Good But raging game
"A faithful port of the original game to Android. While not perfect, most of the bugs are worked out and it is very playable. I've been playing this for awhile and love it. This game is legendary, and no Final Fantasy since 4 has come close."
It's amazing I love shooters
Lags to much
I'm currently trying to get the game back but it won't install
Why the hell do you keep playing with the 2v2 mode? It was good when the button was just beside Battle. Hire a UXer for God's sake! Latest update added more bugs than features!

"Loved this game, had it for years BUT only lately have I realized that it's rigged. I'm often given pieces that can't fit so I can never improve my high score. The ads are really long and now it's not worth it"
"You need more content, personal track , quests , achievements"
please do something there is many hackers in pvp like while i fight it crashing when i play vs hacker not only that I open the new Goku rose pack many times and get garbage 🗑️
Very nice game but bedwars hacker Ban
The game is really good the only problem with that is that it spam's you with microtransactions
Hi free Fire Ki koren. 😄😀😘
Nice 👍🙂
"this new update is absolute trash. y'all have ruined 2v2 matches with the new retarded estimated wait time's, level caps and removing the ""play again"" button, fix your damn game supercell."
Now me and him are tied on shinys we both have 20
Nice game 👍
"Tooo much gd game . I got a lot of friends in meep city and a lot of games 💀👍. This one game has a lot of games inside! But the ""ban"" and ""reporting"" interrupts cuz today only I got banned for 3 days by of saying ""rn"" , ""DAMN"" ETC I just got shocked when I got ban for saying ""kid"" bruhhh I need it solved plz!"
Super sonic primer
I love it
"I'm having fun so far. Fun room-based danmaku roguelike. Could be good, so a hopeful 4"
Can't stop playing it. I gotta keep going to see what's up next
Playing the computer is impossible. It's so rigged it's unplayable. Waste of money
Do your cars don't have driving wheels? It's not a race
COOL GAME
Iove it
"absolutely love this game, do not understand the recent updates. there is no explanation for how they work or why they are in there. very confusing"
"Hands down graphically the best fps game also in tps . It's incomparable in terms of gun skins, character skins ,vehicles and special abilities in the name of classes . Even if you are a f2p , you won't be disappointed . If you are pro then you can get gun skins more easily . But this is a highly data consuming game . It's take about 30gb when you down all resorces ."
#Freefortnite!!!!! Apple is dumb!!!!! NO BAN!!!!!
Good game
I am speaking from Bangladesh. I am trying hard to open the account but I can't open the account.
It's a good port but the controls are a bit clunky
This game constantly gives you ads and when you try to turn on airplane mode you can't unlock anything
"This game is very interesting, the gameplay,the characters, everything is good.But I think free fire should be able to climb trees,that would make the game look a little bit more realistic. Aside from that the game is fun"
Really good
It is better
My favourite game
"I would say three stars on this because it's on the offline stuff and when I get out of my internet it's online it says ""please connect on the internet to continue"""
It has lots of different games depending on your style and also you can customize your character to make it look how you want

Rumor. Their's a man that still likes turtles ellipsis
"Good but not perfect. If your looking for a game like destiny but characters that remind you of Borderlands, Then this is the game for you. My only complaint is that I wish it got updated more but still a strong player base. The game is not dead.. Still very alive."
This sick and useless app don't waste your time
The game is so good

Love Monopoly.
I download this game because I see movie of sonic that because I became a fan of this game
The game is good the touchpad experience is also good but it will be better if we were able to use a controller to play the game the controls just seems more natural to use the touchpad experience is a little confusing other than that this is a really solid game mad props to the developer's graphic wise is a solid 7 or 8 I'm impressed I can't lie keep up the good work

"I did a factory reset my phone. After login QQ in same phone, i found it has no brain that the verification has only one option, only goes through scanning 2D code."
They literally put bot in our team which is really Annoying and they think we ain't going to notice that.
Super gam wanfafull.
This game is amazing it's wow but l gave it 4 stars because the market is not selling we'll fix it please we need to sell Players over 1.000.000 faster update the market plz it's almost impossible the the 1.000.000 players now
I love Sonic and all but the controls can be a little janky at times and can make me make mistakes I just need the controls to be fixed so I won't make as many mistakes and get as many game and maybe some other people might need those controls fixed as well
Fun I recommend
This game is great its fun to play and also it has a realistic graphics
Lies me i liked the game any way
Good
wow nice its a good game
"Hard to advance, even with power ups, many glitches that go unfixed that also impedes progress. Only play this when I'm waiting for lives to generate in other games."
"When you need to use 900 coins to win less than 70 coins is a real waste. Having to use 3 and 4 points to do a a item is just nuts,and all those things to so call make the garden prettier is a waste of points. Som even games never enough trys to get done. It's not fun anymore. You have a superhard leval, with such few tries that need to be done on first try. Give me a break, I am not the developer."
Fun
All yes🥰🥰
Badest game ever
Best

Horrible it keeps doing ads and every sec is another ads it's soo bad

Trouble loading right off ! Hope it improves.
"I was simultaneously playing this game for months to get my score higher each day but all of a sudden, after almost 3 months of playing, it suddenly closed by itself and when I opened the app again, my game was ended and I have to play a new game FROM 0 AGAIN. It made me angry so I'm giving 1 star"
"Very satisfying game, just wow!!!. Love it..."
Great game
Game doesn't work anymore I want my money back stupid game
The game is very great
It was so nice game
"The gameplay and the walkthrough is way cool. ITS AWESOME! but the only reason Im giving a 4 star is because there's only a slight chance of getting an ultra or an unique character, sometimes it gets boring to play with the same characters for months so I can only suggest to increase the chances of getting a new and an unique character otherwise it totally depends on the team, Thank you!"
This game is too realistic
It's hard to play but I like to play because of the gameplay
Cool This is fun
"Played first level, tried to collect rewards, couldn't. According to game I am not connected to internet, I have network error 7. Apart from that, can't even comment on game"
It pretty good but some bosses are really hard to beat if you don't have good characters but still I'll give it 5 stars
It's wonderful 🥰🥰😊

"Ever since the update came out yesterday, I can't view Market Place nor the see my skins."

I love this game. But the puzzles with the character stopped very soon. Also now there aren't enough side games and the game is becoming monotonous. One more thing winning on the spin game is almost impossible as I've won the bonus once. And I'm up to level 4000. Not happy
It's awesome when I got it I spent 10$ 5stars but I hope in the future there are a few coll free add-ons like more pickaxes but aver all 5-5
Good
It's good

Love this game
"Nothing interesting, People will team up against you or cheat you. Dangerous if your short tempered, so download at your own risk"
The best for waiting uber cuz gameplay is shotplay

Extremely fun!
Fun with minimal adds
I bought this game with a 10 google play at 4.99 how is it that it took my whole 10 google play credit that makes no sense and Google doesn't give you any option to fix the issue talking about it doesn't qualify
"So far so good. Edit: unable to connect to cloud, it says failed to connect even if i have good internet connection. Pls fix this. Edit: cloud save has been fixed now, thanks."
Very good. Well

Sonic has a 666 version sonic.exe
It is so much fun and I am not sure but a little good.
It was a good game I see why mr.beast sponsored it.
Keep stopping and turn to the homescreen. Unable to load.
Awsome
Uninstalled coz no gyroscope !! Which top FPS game doesn't have gyro nowadays ??
"I purchased this game for my Odin handheld device, it says it was compatible. I was so disappointed I wasted 1.99 for nothing, very time I try to start the game it goes to the start screen for sonic for a split second and then goes back to the settings screen. The  screen that asks if you want a new game or to continue or to change the settings. It will do this every time so I can't even play the game, like a glitch that makes it unplayable!!! VERRY DISSAPOINTED TO WASTE 1.99 FOR NOTHING !"
Best game
"This game is very nice, but 4 stars because there are levels which are very hard and it takes many days to pass them, and also it takes 30 minutes to refill each life. Earlier it took only 5 minutes to refill a life. Please fix some of these problems."
The best game ever I played in my life
"Ma mise à jour ne veut pas s'installer depuis des mois. Je suis toujours bloqué à 26mb. Wifi ou données mobiles, c'est la même"

"I love the game and have come back to it multiple times. I recently left a review regarding my crashing and promised to change it to 5 stars if the problem was fixed, the problem was fixed and my game hasn't crashed in months. Such a blast! Thanks for whatever you guys did!"
Perfect. A little confused by all the information at first but soon got the hang of it. Amazing graphics and interesting storyline
very bad. shame for its large audience in China. a large population deserve something better.
best game in the worldddd
Verry nice game
I grew up playing minecraft bedrock when I was 6 And I love the game
Great 😃👍
I love this game sturnts are the best....
Is sonic.exe in game
Buggy at times. Lots of fun if you get the right account. May have to set up a fee until you find one that consistently catches shinies... you want a middle number not a beginning or end number. And you are not aware of this in any way shape or form. Good luck. 👍
This game is chutiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .
Do not Want to see this ad anymore!
Always My favourite game
Sike five star orankes you
i tried downloading 4.11.0 update from app store and installing latest update but the installation can complete give me always.dont know what to do.please developer help
devs: thankyou devs I already tried your method it works now thanks I will inform devs if there's a bug or something wrong with the game
it didnt let me play the game
Ggs
The ads are a bit annoying but every thing else is actually fine!
This game was an absoloute legend but it has a lot of ads that makes the game unplayable
In every update the game get worth.. My device is supporting 60 FPS and inside the game it only give me 25 FPS !!!
Installing now has issues been fixed.... Keo server was right it could have been made better but it's not nothing fixed
Please fix the extra life ads. I still die while having watched the ad. It's a complete waste of time.
Update is terrible!!! Much harder and easily get wiped out of chances because if location of squares. Have played this game for years no I think I need to move on. Update hardly lets you get a decent score!!!!
Very very nice and good game 👍
faltu ghatiya purana game
I love this game and it is good for kids
"A very bad experience. As soon as a match ends, the add comes on. I mean, it's a really bad game."
I like this game but pls finish the maintenance quickly
Nice game
it's very good game
"Not bad, great A.I., graphics look good, though all the tokens make the exact same tapping noise, and in general, very blah sound all around. Not sure why anyone would pay for extra for tokens that don't do much other than look different. ""Auction only"" is the most skillful way of playing, but the variation is less than the previous developer for Hasbro that did a better job save for the A.I."
It is not atall optimised for android my device is OnePlus 7t and while I play this game there is never ending lag
i love it
Amazing
Top Game <3
This game sucks players are toxic nerf brawlers I hate this game it can get screwed the teamers are unreal surge needs a buff and he getts counterd by every brawler so fix your game

Its the best game once you get a hang of it like you could really really get a nice fun 15 games out of this and you'll like it if you just grind and put in the effort you would make this game your favorite
"Add battle pass and better shooting input in pvp. Using my Razer Kishi sucks as I try to trace and shoot. The bullets have a delay. If you want more money add battle pass for premium weapons, armor, and skins. Update your tweets. That's how most gamers find out about game updates."
This game sucks
It's better than the original
"Wrost game i had ever seen in my life, playing from 8 hours, lossing every matches continuously, in ranked mp, the most wrost game ever seen. 😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
"It doesn't let me login, it doesn't let me reset password, very slow network, but I am using 5G. It says the version is too low, but it is the latest version from Google store."
I just love the game
Game is amazing but we just tried to do a Thunderus raid and it kicked us out now we can't get back in the raid since it just keeps loading doing nothing.
Was a child gambling game now its at its worst
i really like this game but i gave it 4 stars because for low devices like 2and 1 gb ram it just have a lag for me .For new players its very fun and you should try it
really nice game I enjoyed
Great game
"Was fun, now not so much. More of a money grab these days."
"Nice Game, but must unlock some more countries for free"
Nice
This game is fun if you don't want to get a pay it so I play on my tablet and it good the ads don't bother me I love this game and I beat it nice work
"Please fix this bug, in the blockman go app it says the game has more than 0 players but when I join the game it has 0 players but in the app it says like 50 players so pleaseeeee fix this it happens in games like The exorcists etc."

Terms of use unacceptable.

Malos servers

But very very late to connect server and login game.So I very angry
Very fun
Good
"Halo,aku baru di game gta san andreas ini,aku baru aja beli game ini pas hari sabtu(hari ini). Jadi gimana cara main misi² gitu?kayak youtubers yg main gtaSA. ;) yah mungkin bisa di youtube?? (Youtuber yg main gtaSA yg aku suka:tukang game,kawan kita,sama syawal_gaming. ;)"
I love it
goood
A great port to allow some nostalgic gameplay
Nice and relaxing game
Square is a rip off. Don't buy anything from them.
Game jelek tukang scam di game sky block mengapa pas dulu sky block kenapa gak di tambahin vitur trade sistem dulu Kalo dulu jika ada vitur ini pasti aku kasih bintang 5 dasar gak peka
Good game
"End of the game the other player goes bankrupt and i get all the properties. Yet the game showed the bankrupt player won the game. Game has alot of glitches. Classic gets stuck, quick mode had the above mentioned issue. Waste of money"
Does this version have the speed boost or just max everything i rather do speed runs since i know the game inside and out. Always a fun play through regardless though.
Beautiful
Good
Life changing
"Very fun but I wish a larger variety of pokemon would spawn. The devs say there are 600+ pokemon that spawn but there's usually only like 10-15 different types of pokemon that spawn for weeks at a time. Catching the same 10 pokemon over and over isn't really ideal, plus I have older missions that I can't complete because the pokemon for those missions just won't spawn anymore. Like I said very fun but I just wish we would get the variety they were advertising"
This is so hard but i love it geat work to creator 😎😋😊
Awesome 👍
This is a great game and has lots to do. I have had the game for a while now and it's still good but i wish they would add more ways to get elite points
Game crashes frequently
I love the game but after the last update I can't enter into the game
FUN! ADDICTIVE! PEACEFUL!
Super sonic primer
i have a lot of fun but i think it can improve
"My app is not working error is occurring again and again I also have installed it many times but not working, even though I have reboot my phone still showing error"
I love how I can build stuff on my own with out any help and I can mind diamonds
I really like this game alot it's my favorite now
Rev got view city came Gi
Very good👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Sad it doesn't make fun anymore.
Nice
Love the game but why change what has worked for ages. I don't like the undo at all
Kinda LAGGY And also please the celebration of the players
this is a good game but if you don't like killing or Ragdolls don't play this but to me it's really fun and easy for me! I love this game try it see how you like it and rate the game!
Great
Very bad app due to its large size can't able to install ugh my data pack got waste pls adjust the game size in the next update
Ignore if you dont like a long road block barrier and stall for months. Not progressive game. Uninstall cash cow p2w expensive.
Amazing
Good for waste time
"I have a lot of problems with this game. It's a good game, I like the graphics, characters and so on, but this game lags and crashes. I hope you can fix it🙏♥️."
"God damn awesome. This is one of the best games of all time and this version plays even better than the original playstation one. The characters, the story and the music get me every time. This game is timeless. Edit:Playing several months later, I started to have issues with crashing. I set phone to ""pro gamer"" mode, which blocks notifications and limits background apps from running. This solved the issue, so if anyone else has this issue, check background apps and ram usage. Hope it helps you"
I really loved this game when I began playing but after hitting so many walls that seem impossible to climb without paying to win I feel this game lost some of its luster. However it's still a good game despite its greedy undertones.
Good game but remove this armor break rune and thorn runes thats why I give 3star
非常差劲的体验
Its very good game
gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool!!!
Best game i ever played
amazing
Great
This game is working properly I am not able to join the game Worst experience
Nice 😁☺👍✌
"All aspects of this game are awesome, but their support staff is the best in the business. Recently, I was banned from logging into Shadowgun Legends and didn't know why. Although I was not able to communicate directly with community support, I was able to reach them via the MFG website and, as always, they were Prompt, Polite & Professional with their reply and guidance. Thanks Again MFG!"
Goated
"what the hell is going on with this port? Background music frequently missing, forced close everwhere randomly also!!! I want my money back!!!"
Hi Roblox uh someone is going into my acc/account can you fix this? Thank you
permanently banned me for literally no reason

Nice
This game has good killer and good version kinda hard but i am looking for a challenge
Excellent game
Play版本 都2年 没更新了，最新版本都是 2020年的版本了。过几天 都 2023年了！！。
I came. :)
Love everything about the game. There is so many missions that I will be playing for a long time. There's nothing I'd change. I think the game has it all for a F. P. S. It would be neat to have T. P. S. perspective if it's possible. Thanks for the great game. I was just wondering what happened to the gold ring you receive with your first purchase? I made the purchase but nothing else was said about the ring. Could you please explain why I haven't received anything about the ring. Thank you😁
Excellent app and graphics osam but
"Super fun, I've been in playing it for years"
This game have maintenence problem please solve it
Amazing game with amazing cars
Good🔥🔥
"Great game...except for the dang people with Archers in Monster Arena. Definitely changes the ""game play"" and makes Monster Arena such a waste of time and resources..."
It's an interesting game player
This game is lowkey good

"Hello NetEase, I really loved the game it deserve more downloads, but please reduce game size and make it suitable for 32 bit devices. Thank you for your hard work!"
I'm having a real hard time logging into my account for the last 5 days I can't get my account its finding it buts when I accept to get my account back it's a endless loading cycle believe me last night I went to be with it loading about 9:00 wake about 3 to see its still loading I need help I can't start this again I'm a player of 223 days straight so just understand what I'm talking about
"Avoid, P2W"
"Fun game, but annoying ads. When the game ends it plays an ad that turns the volume down on my music ap"
👌
Use to be. New additions are annoying and unnecessary
Pritty good took some time to understand then just only brawllllll.
"Just as good as the original it might even be better. Edit, once you get farther it tends to need begin freezing up frequently! Like damn, I already had to uninstall before because of this"
Hello after some data resource data download my super Mecha champions keeps force closing I'm using a Google pixel 6A helppp
"So much to do, so much to learn. I suggest watching some YouTube videos before you play"
Bad game ever
Honestly really fun! I enjoy it sm 🫶
5+ stars so far the best game ever
I wish there was seseon 1 the of Map
Unable to create account
It's a fun game to play when you have nothing to do but some that is pretty annoying is that u have to pay for cc
Best game forever
Multiplayer really fun love this game and you will too
FruitNnja
Its an amazing game but I am stuck at level 9 where I have nothing to play and no way to level up. I am unable to play the game.
"I'm noticing these ""boosters"" (yes, quotations!) don't always help! You'll use one thinking you're gonna make the perfect move and the ""booster"" actually BLOCKS you from achieving your goal. If you make it as far as i have, you'll agree. Gotta spend money for gold bars. Addicting. Still...5 stars!"
"Such a nice game with better graphics and game play, I get my Goku black rose full star without spend any money 🤣"
Op game
"Good game, I play regularly. Takes a little too long to finish restoring cars unless you are willing to spend decent money out of your own pocket. Also get sick of watching your reward videos, whether for free fuel or another part, and then not getting the reward. Wish it was a little less ""pay to win"". I understand development costs $$$. But it's ridiculous how long it takes to restore a car without having to pay. Edit: Game will not load at all now.🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
OOO
Loved the game and the quick game for people in a fix! Highly recommend for monopoly lovers!
this is a very cool game im love this so much that this is wwhat i always play all the time
"I love it so much.But I have one problem that I face, when they are sleeping they don't give up early. They were sleeping at too late time🇮🇳💜🇰🇷 please gave a solution 🙏💜🇰🇷🇮🇳"
Op game but it's GB problem but I love 💕😘
"So many adventures to choose to play,yes it is good game,but for the ""akashic ruin"",it's difficult to reach to last level,I hope there's also a guide like the other level,I'm very upset.Please help me"
"I think it's pretty fun. It's much easier to play with friends and family on the app than the actual game. No math, counting, or space taken up by the large board. It can be hard to play a game all at once so it's nice you can pause games whenever, then take them out when you want to continue. The game also let's you play against a computer or other people, in case other people don't want to play. A clean and fun game!"
Op
"This is the best game, I have ever played every time I open my phone it's the the number one app I touch and it's also allows to play with friends and family if they have the game, creator's sure worked hard and it was worth it"
Good game put one person would leave and then the game is stuck and ruins it for everyone else! Replace them with a bit or something? Maybe even a 30sec timer unless they are making a trade or house mortgage! Or I get stuck and can't press anything!! FIX THIS BUG SO EVERYONE CAN PLAY
Addictive great game
It fell off
Best game ever
I give 3 stars because after I finished renovating a garden it says open a new area but it's not updating 2 days had passed but still not working please fix this
Great games fun and exciting!
Good
Cod pleas give me ak117 holidays I love codm 😍😍😍😍
"This is the worst computer cheating game I've ever played and unfortunately paid for.I have won 1 of 20 or so games against only 1 computer opponent.The computer lands on Go, chance or Commchest nearly every roll.You will roll the worst numbers possible nearly every time.Resulting in a further loss to you. I understand the algorithm is supposed to create a challenge, but I just feel cheated, every game.I will be deleting this game right after I request a refund. Update, read comments, TERRIBLE.."
Can't even login without a China mobile number.
Best drag racing game in play store
Wow 😳😳😳😳
"Excuse my word, but fcukyou gardens Cape. Ok. This is the only game I love to play,and I already reach 12000+level, some super hard level is super hard to win, but atleast when we tried about an hour I can completed. But this morning cannot win no matter how many time I try even spend all my star to have live,??!!!!! What is wrong with you?!!?, I almost broke my phone because of you. And always notify me to buy live 😠 don't be too greedy"
"Good game, but.... too hard to get a Gold Bar.."
"Freezes without letting me play. It used top work perfectly, but for no reason it doesn't work anymore. I liked the game, but now I'm a sad panda. Edit 1/23: all fixed and back to playing"
Its mwah!
This is so good
"When i started playing this game a month ago it was running great and in a month i got to max level of 27, but then i started facing multiple problems like not getting the rewards as shown in the loot and, the start screen repeating itself between hub page, Wargame page and login page. I really love this game but, frequently like i missed NikoStopper Gun and Tesla, though i have them in my inventory but you never know which particular Gun has best combination of Perks to help in Overall Game."
It is a very fun game but it banded me for one day I could of gave this five stars but this disappointed me much and I pressed log out and I nid to start every thing again
Please give us new ultra legendary weapon for something new in game
"It was probably my favorite game back in 2018, but now I see no one playing the og games that a lot of og players used to play. I feel pretty old just looking back at how much the community grown after these past year. I'm pretty sad I did lose my rich account but then again I wouldn't be playing this game now or somewhere in the future but it was fun playing this game and being able to paly with friends. I only wished to meet them in real life so we could communicate more. Thank you blockman go"
Only for paid players not for free to play
Figured since it's 2022 .. and it's an app the classic shouldn't be so annoying anymore .. NOPE.. they just added chars .. didn't support the game frame at all.. sonic still slides terrible.. still a super slow startoff .. which results in very annoying gameplay ... Little things such as these can make or break a game.. .
Awsome
"Remember your game Clumsy Ninja? Fix it please, when we go back to the game. It is deleted"
Some games are a bit laggy. But a range of games to pick that are fun.
Good
Why I'm not able to reinstall this game
"Es un buen porteo, pero tiene problemas con los controles, Sonic reacciona muy lento"
I love this game is Soper cool
This is a pretty cool game i play it when im bored
Bad😡😡
The worst game ever
I love pokemon
This app no longer works on my computer.
It pretty good but some bosses are really hard to beat if you don't have good characters but still I'll give it 5 stars
Awesome
U guys suck go do something better ediotic bastards
"Good game,too many annoying glitches please fix them it pisses me off and also u can't fully move the map"
Good time pass

I like how there are mutiple mode to play but I don't like how they did not make the illusioner an egg and you have to summon it
Super fun and realistic.
"Ok update this game keeps crashing ....it's says ""broken file please re install game "" I have played this game up to 18th ranking then it loses it data developer needs to fix this permanently this is the best shooting game on Android I hate to give this a one star"

"Too many gacha games fail to find the balance between gameplay and lottery. This game reminds me of Epic Seven, another gacha to have excellent balance. Well done."

"This is a very good blast from the past! This is good I won't deny it. But I liked it more when it had the D pad, I tried to spin dash away from a incoming projectile but the joystick registered it as jumping so I jumped into it and since I had no rings and 1 life, I died and got a game over. Please go back to the D pad as the joystick isn't reliable"
Why is it 1.2 gigabytes
Great game!
This game is terrible. I would give it -5 stars if I could.
Very good

Google pls pay attention to this game they are banning players for saying hi and youtube YouTube is your child this game must me banned

Wow
Why did I pay for the ad free version only to have it be taken away by a stupid update that no one asked for? Bring back the ad free version that I PAID FOR.
Why can't i install it 😔
"First of all Great game, I hope you keep improving the game specially the lag issues and match making coz its ruining the game. Please fix it asap 🙏🙏🙏"
Very fun
This is very very very very nice game
Very fun

Extremely obtrusive ads to malware.
"If I am trying to sign up, code is not coming to my phone They also ask me to download the new version to be able to sign up, please which one is the new version of QQ"
This game is amazing but I had one problem that is when round starts in cs ranked or clash squad when the dissappear it does not my all teammates go but not please fix
This is a very beautiful game
Amazing!
Bad losers ruin it. People get angry that you refuse trades or that they are losing and stall the game by viewing and reviewing properties so their turn won't time out. There is no safeguard against this kind of behavior and it ruins the game.
I cried myself to sleep because of this horid game
This is the ragest game I have ever played
It's really nice
Very nice 🎮
Please can't find the cheat on my playstore why?
Very Hard Game For F2p.. But Nice Game

nicce app
I've always been a fan. I just started back playing now there is so much more to do !
"Can't use the app because it isn't updated to the ""latest version"" so they want you to go to their website and download an apk..... Yeah no. SHADY."
like game
I am a big fan of gta . This one is a very good game .
The game is very good . We can join a club or create our own and if do not have a star power or gadget I can try it in friendly mode I think that if the gems are easier to earn it would be great exit the new update got rid of boxes
"Game is pay to progress and nothing has changed for years ! Nice graphics, smooth intense gameplay, good sound all ruined buy pure developer greed! For me to upgrade my hero at its current state would cost me over £240!. To regularly update the heroes and weapons to progress that would cost like £600 -£1000 a month! Game developer never listens to the players about cutting the cost of the game and being able to buy specific upgrades for the weapon or the hero you have!Can't progress ,Stay away !"
It won't load in a Samsung galaxy S20+ with the last updates.
can't register
Great fun game great driving game
I love this game!

"Paid for the ad free version and then the app updated and took away my add free status. It wants me to pay again to go as free, no thanks. Uninstalled."
Netease games is garbage
Nice game 🎮🎯
Was cool but within the past 30 days it has been a HASSEL!!! Hard time logging in
Oum.....the game is good
The game is good
your game its so hard and the blocking are delay
These so called updates never fix anything in this game. Good potential but the game sux as it is now.
"This game is very good. It allows you to build your creations, play with other people and socialise and more! It's a great game for my children. With the new exciting updates, I can ensure that my children could play."
80g free yet not enough space to play this game... Foh y'all doing way too much
Wonderful game my favourite but it takes so much time to upgrade please reduce some time
This game is the beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest please make more games like this
"Great stuff. Truly enjoy playing, it's refreshing always"
This game is so enjoying. I play this game everyday to get log in bonus and to complete the daily missions and to collect the rewards.I also play PVP and Tournament of Power and I like them.
Very nice game
Went from barely tolerable to utter garbage. I don't know what they were thinking with this new update but it was enough for me to finally walk away.
It's a very good game
Osm
Hiiiy
Glad to have access to a classic game in my hand.
ليست سيئة 😊
The game is amazing and fun. But it would be better if there was a option of attacking your own base layout to check if the layout is strong enough to defend from other players
nic play app
It's a potty good one 👍 and skho shakal✌🏻💦
Very op game
Ok
Why is it so hard to sign up? 😑
Good game
Trash
So enjoy to play and so relaxing game ☺️
This game is fun expeasllywhen we play
"The game frequently forces you to buy and spend to offshoot the purposeful sabotage the AI during autoplay (switches players so they can die or before making critical combinations), slowing gameplay to an impossible craw when attempting to play on your own. Setting matches up for failure. Speeding opponent response and actions while slowing or inhibiting personal moves."
Super game
"Very Fun, easy to learn"
Want to give 5 star but the game disappointed me... When I watch ads the game crashes and it say pending the they never give the rewards so it is a waste of time please do something......🙏👍
Pretty addicting

"Well the game is exceptional and very high in graphics. Because of that it's one best car game on earth, it takes time to beat the boss's but you can race each other, like all the other csr games this is fernomel or in your words amazing."
Yeah it's a good game but of 4 star cause that when in a middle of a game sometimes the screen get stuck so possibly fix that
Normal match making is really bad. Get super lop sided lobbies where I will be grouped with 3-4 iron players and the other team will have 1 iron and 3-4 plat+ players. Super fun riot. Thanks.
Good game lot pokemon
Its a fun game i never would of though i could play monoply on my phone but there are a few bugs that need to be worked on one when i tried to do custom rules the screen goes either to a blank white screen or just completely black and there should be a time limit for the player rollering the dice like 2 or 5 minute time or so when there not rolling or trying to make a deal with another player and same with trying to choice a play peace the screen goes completely blank
Nice Nice Nice Nice game I like this game 🎮
This game is very good. 10/10
Games in play store in very super
Best game and graphics I play daily
"Stupid AFK ban delaying U should do it on PC game just AFK for a minute doing some stuff and back to play but still get AFK ban, why not u do something on AFK or trolling game on PC. Uninstalled right after 1 game never be back"
Wonderful I love it so much 💙💙💙💜❤
everything in this game is good but the penalty is just annoying it takes to long to get into a match.. hope you will lessen the penalties
I dont like this app i hate it so much it has too many ads😡
Good 👍
"Awesome! They have 2 of my cars on here which is a Fiesta ST and Focus RS/ST. The Fiesta is just as quick as mines in RL. Stage 3 mods. COBB accessport, COBB stage 3 tune, Whoosh Catless Downpipe, MBRP full exhaust system, SPEC stage 3+ clutch and aluminum Flywheel, Turbosmart BOV and ADDW1 oil catch can. A couple of more mods and then I'm done. Next project will be my Focus ST! WOOT WOOT!! Again like I said, this game is awesome 👌 👏 👍 😍"
No Music? this has been modified! not worth paying for!
Nagyon jó játék csak az a baj hogy kivették a boxokat. Nekem:8590kupám van. Most már 11000kupàm van
"So much to do, so much to learn. I suggest watching some YouTube videos before you play"
Very nice app 👌

"What's the problem with your app.? Why can't I update it.? I tried to reinstall it, but it’s still not working.! 😐😐 My phone model is ""Galaxy J7 Prime""."
Great game few of folks are right about level going up against higher level ya get lucky sometimes other its crush .plus 2v2 ya get someone who doesn't even try .its a game folks a game .join a clan is cool . It's a little m ok ney for pass but it's nice. They are growing hopefully $$$ wont go nuts . But all things do .have fun folk
I love it
"And now after the latest update.... the game closes out and shuts down when I try to download all the resources, maps and all the essential downloads. This is bull. Thanx allot."
Its perfect but its hard to get any characters without paying means you either need luck or money so yeah please give ultras more presentage rate Thanks
Plese give me won in macth... I lose every i play de toty challenge....🥹🥹
It's good the graphics is good and a very smood controle i love it but when u first play it ur VS bots for a long time which makes me kinda mad cuz it's easy but the bigger rank u get the harder it gets and u go VS real players so ye after all its good. I would give it 5 stars If they would add more free rewards in the BR pass cu it like 2 free stuf per 5-7 tiers so that's kinda all I never had any issue so te game is very good. Thanks for the hard work u guys put in the game!
Other than the fact that it's pay to win this game is great
"I hate this game it has ruined me. My alt gets everything I want but can't get. He just got ultra Rosé on the first summon, but on my main I've spent over 6000 CC and still haven't got him. Just add pity already."
Is fun
"Oh man, been playing this game FOR YEARS. My favorite part was that there was no undo, when you lose you lose. Can't believe this update."
I like this game because it was a stunt driving game. This is a fun game. This is my favorite game. You should play this game
"Can't send/recieve friends requests, and neither can any of my friends."
"Good but please improved more, very stressing game"
Wow this game is so cool I love it so much
not up to date and cant long in or sign up
Good
Only a loser can understand a feeling of loser 😂
I love this game but i hate the credits i wish you would please bring back boxes i would rate 10 stars if i could :)
Roblox Is very fun I love it but the only thing I hate about roblox Is the removal of so many audios I miss Rick rolling people I miss playing my favorite star wars tunes but now there gone roblox please bring them back
Immediately froze my phone. I couldn't do anything on my Flip 3 after it said it required Wifi to download. Took forever to figure out how to restart my phone. Don't bother with this game!
Amazing game 👍
Game is banned in Vietnam for some reason
This game is excellent Port but you're going to have trouble in the marble Zone. The Precision platforming is tricky but not impossible. Other than that one's own the controls are great.
Yamete
great game still addicted to playing this game yet it never gets old
Good game
Fun game
Nice but net slow
Wow
"doesn't count steps anymore. I've left the game closed for some time now, when u open the game, it never counts the steps that have accumulated (which is many). really sick of trying to get candy when the game doesn't even do what it's supposed to do. this is probably why I put it down for months. the time has passed, Pokemon GO is another to only be opened seldom now."
fun so far
Alot of relaxation
So fun
After update the ads couldn't collect the item and the key
Nice
Please i want to update my qq to the latest version
Thx for the fix

"Started playing free fire in 2018.I left playing ff in 2022.It's a trash now.Everything changed.I wish one day garena will turn this game to it's old version where there was no lagging,no ping issue,no exit of factory rooftop,no pay to win,no chances to get old items back just peace."
😷
I really love this game
After some levels game is crashing
An I please have my money back for this because it doesn't work on my phone anymore so I'd really like my money back if I don't get it back you will be hearing from my lawyers
"Thank you for the response about player progression. I would also spend more on it if there was currency to lose or earn from other players. For example, if it costs you $1,500 to play and eventually you lose all your money by buying into too many games and not winning any. Not only would players need to earn that money, wait an amount of time, or pay for it if decided. But each game you'd get a chance to win cash based on how much total rent received to play a few more times. Get rich or lose."
The raid won't load it sucks
It is good K I love dragon ball Legends pickles super Saiyan Broly and super Saiyan God Goku and Vegeta And I have super Saiyan super Saiyan Goku I have Goku and I have super Saiyan gogeta Dragon Ball Legends address for you and God for you L
Good
server error like every time
I would love to give this 5 stars but all of the dialog has been blacked out and I have no idea what is being said. Some of the world gets blacked out as well and I'm stuck with my character running through a blank screen at times.
Enjoying the game but can easily be come a money trap..be like me f2p
"Seems good, but really could do with a fast forward button like the other games have."
Nice
"When I earn 500+/1000 coins every time match the total coins shows only 400/500. Why is this happening? I should have 35000+ coins, but showing only 2000. Even every time I enter the game it shows different coins, like 1000 one time, 500 the next time, 800 the next time! Why?? Because of this I can't even buy the features I want."
I love the game
Friar was born and loved
Sonic asome and cool looking! Tails and sonic are going to be partners and cool looking

The best game I've ever played

"Very very enjoyable, love it"
משחק תןב
It's pretty good good graphics I like how it does animation and stuff but I would really like if u guys would add like a difficulty like if it's hard the enemies would be tougher and more smart overall it's a really good game I recommend u this game if like games with really good graphics and good gameplay

this is a terrific dustbin nothing else... you have money buy players win matches. there is nothing fare in this game...this is to ea sports 🖕🖕🖕
"We will see if it is worth a 5 star or not. To be continued. Starts out fun turns into a job, not worth it. IGN can't even pair kingdoms to fight that are even close in might or abilities."
My Fabret Game Amazing Game
Best game ever
"What's everyone's high score? Mines 10320. For the people that make this game, could you incorporate a score board of people playing the game? Please. I have spent literally years playing this, thousands of hours lol. My new high score is 17,921. Update as of 10/26/22 - Uninstalled this game because I was playing it too much. Reinstalled recently and with the update it's not the same. The developers should have an option to have both the old version and the new one."
Interesting and entertaining
All yes🥰🥰
Very fun

"I've been playing pubg mobile for a long time in the world and i believe it's the world's greatest Battle Royale Game but ever since the update 2.5 came I've been having log in delays and i even die from fall damage in the game like always ,and the log in delay has gotten worse that i can no longer log into my account anymore,Please PUBG MOBILE TEAM fix this issue plz plz plz plz plzzzz🙏🙏🙏"
ALL TIME BEST MOBILE GAME
The best game I've ever played
It's reached the end of it's fun cycle and each update pushes it towards a pure cash grab. They've removed any incentive to play 2v2 by capping cards at 11 and removing crowns and chests. This was the only mode I've played in 5 years so there's no point in me continuing to play.
This game is really awesome.. As you get the diamonds you become happy as you got it in real☺☺☺
Game is awesome But after this update Games are automatically Back and facing problem
This was a good game until the amount of cheaters in pvp made the game unplayable. very disappointing.
Brings back memories
Nice game
Super game 💗
STUPID NoooooooB game. Every single match have to face Max lvl 14. 2v2 is the place where nooob rules. Edit: Uninstalled the game after latest update 😁. No reason to play the DEAD & STUPID game anymore. No fun at all like it is used to be. *****Do not install the game****
It's good quality and game play
But very very late to connect server and login game.So I very angry
Uhh Yyu Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmhjrm

"Can't catch any pokemon since the update. The app freezes and the screen goes white. Would love to keep playing, but what am I gonna do w a useless app?"
I think it's easy too laggy whenever i encounter an enemy and worse i start firing ay them it starts freezing up..

The game connection keeps disconnecting despite the fact I have strong WiFi and / or 5gs
Good

After playing for 3 days the game just shuts down itself and can't continue the game no more. A waste of money
The game's actually fun and addictive and from my pov everything is ok with the game but I don't see why we can't trade or upgrade old special upgrade card now I've got up to 50 bronze 2 upgrade card but it's just useless and I still get more as I login into the game Pls just let us be able to upgrade them if you do so then I'll rate 5 stars
What the hell!!!!!
My son has loved all the updates for the velcles
It's sonic and it's hard to find an emulator rom for Sega's baby. Also I feel that touchscreen controls takes away from the original experience on mobile.
This Makes me a mad racer
This game is so good 🔥
What this game needs is to be under 50 mb
Nunca saben como balancear un brawler
I dont like this app i hate it so much it has too many ads😡

This game graphics is very very good. I have played this game for 3 years and this game very interesting.
It signed me out for no reason
cannot log in without update and no update available best app of the year
It is a if if situation but I like it but also it won't let me download. P.S. I'm rating 4 stars just to be nice😁
Astar
"Guys!do not dowloads this app,it stole u phone information,track ur phone,it gets everything form u phone,u dowload it,and it knows all the privacy information form ur phone!"
Am giving 4 because every time opponent will get troop faster than me
I enjoy this game its so fun and great to go out walking and explore
decent game but it's insane how much space it requires/ takes up in your storage and the ads have gotten way too excessive.
Love this game just wish phone hade more space to hold all the ff titles lol
"Great game. I especially enjoy the events and there is something to do every day. A few weeks ago I even got the 180 day login badge. I've wanted to spend some money on because of how much I've been enjoying it, but this being my one issue with the game, even the cheapest options in the shop is very expensive. My guess it's probably because the prices are being converted into my local currency. It would be nice if there were more affordable options though."
I absolutely love this app so very much
My favourite strategy game ever
This game is loads of fun.
Fun game 👍
Nice game
nice
Very relaxing 😌 easy.
I can't install this game i need help
Love it!
Hhh
Nice game
"Still, matchmaking are the worst ,i just silver and yet met higher rank,and when they use mecha and hit me the damage just so worse, when i do that ,the damage i dealt is low,fix matchmaking issue"
"The game is a 10/10, the only little thing is that you have to start matching players based on theyre stats, not on theyre rank. Because there are a lot of iron players boosted into diamond and master, who are ruining games constantly"
Love this game always something to do love it.
Fun
After the update ranke are nat down fall you can made h new rank

"If these same ads continue I will remove,over and over the same one,I have,been playing for many years,first time I've complained .well goodbye game every bloody ad is religion in my face had enough asked several times not to post but you keep going.Shove it."
I love the game.
it is a really cool game but to much ads
"Hold up, I paid for this game before and now because I got a new phone I have to repay? Same account mind you as I paid for 9 as well and still have that. What gives?"
I'm giving it 4 stars because you deleted astrocraft
I like mobile adventure just make more update
"Full of cheaters. This game used to be fun, but every single match I get into, I'm encountering tons of cheaters. 2 matches in a row had the same person who had their mecha fully charged within 30 seconds of match starting. I'm done with this game until you take serious action on this."
"Slow and laggs alot , it's sad cut I use to love this game"
"It's irritating that they did away with the ad-free version of this app. What is even more annoying is watching an entire 30 second ad and then the game saying I skipped the ad, thus taking away the reward. This is happening almost everytime now and makes me want to just delete the app for good. I always keep my app updated, so that's not the issue."
Pretty addicting
enjoy and good time pass
its nice
Nice Game To Play In Free Time...❤️👍
Awsome
It works alright for me. Except for the occasional game crashes. But the motorcycle minigame at Midgar is too fast. Gold Saucer is still a legendary time sink.
I just bought every house there is so nobody was able to buy any hotels. It was only a matter of time before I bankrupt everyone and started swimming in cash.
A very nice game
Friar was born and loved
cool
Bunch of noob player
It is so fun
"The game is good no doubt, multiplayer is introduced but thers only one drawback is that if you delete the game and reinstall it, it starts from the very beginning and we have to grind the game all again .so if we can link our accounts with google play or with google etc it will be more beneficial that we will not lose our previous game data. So just want u guys to add a login system . I'll be waiting for a response . Thank you"
I enjoy the game but lately I can't join friends and family on the same Wi-Fi pls fix.
"The theme collection $35, too high. $10 for sure you can make more money than restricting it with that high price. The inc one beautiful || The account option is good,but for a game that has no score or statistics it doesn't make sense...please add that feature to the Sudoku ver that really needs this to be able to play it on more than one device and keep the progress.I would like to play that game on another device, but for now the lack of an account is forcing me to play it just on one phone."
Good 👍
😀😀😀😁😂😃😃😃😎
I love Chinese people and chinese culture! This is my reason to dowenload and use this app☺️
I like it and I'm new at this game but it is 😎 cool
Sonic has a 666 version sonic.exe

Game crash on sega intro
This game is so amazing
Good game. Would have given 5 stars but I paid $2 to have the ads removed. They were not removed. I wasted my $2. If I press the rotate button I still have to put the phone down and wait until stupid videos finish playing. Don't waste your money paying to remove ads.
Love this game always something to do love it.
"Hello epic,games please can you increase the fps of the game to 60 and in next update please improve your controls otherwise it a very nice game to play thanks."
Best game everrr

Awesome 👍
0 STARS I HATE THIS GAME I NEEDED G-CUBES I DONT HAVE MONEY STUPID GAME UGHHHH!!!!
"Archaic graphics. Unattractive, forgettable heroes. Couldn't look past that to even comment on gameplay. This game looks like it was drawn by amateurs, 20 years ago."
Network issues
"Why can't these games EVER be as advertised??? This is a standard Match 3 game and NOT at all like the fun of the advertisement! No pull the pin, no escaping danger type things at all. Very disappointed."
Good remake. I gave it 4 stars because in the chocobo races for the last week solid the mountain\river jockey has been in every single race. That never happened in the original. Can't level chocobos if you can't win a race.
Close as you're going to get your console version of dragon Ball z
Bad graphics
Decently good
My problem is my phone can't run this well because I have android 9.0 and it lags and crashes

"Updated in July, fixing cloud saves. A classic game and a decent port."
"Feel pretty much scammed. Opening fmv has music, soon as gameplay begins there's no music. Tried to get a refund and google says no of course. Sad to see such a classic treated this way. Hopefully SE can eventually be bothered to fix it."

"I did a factory reset my phone. After login QQ in same phone, i found it has no brain that the verification has only one option, only goes through scanning 2D code."

"Most of the times, it gets disconnected during the end game... Its like spending all that time for nothing... Wasted my money... Please refund"

"This used to be my favorite casual game. For years, I would play when I felt like it (sometimes hours at a time), then take a break for a while, before picking up where I left off. Now, if I go away mid-game, when I come back, it shows me game over despite not having lost by backing myself into a corner. I have to start over from scratch. It starts a new game, new score, but because it starts by wiping out my previous progress, I already feel like I don't want to play. Because what's the point?"
"Fun game but unfortunately while it is rated PEGI 7, my 8 year old son can't play it on his tablet due to not meeting the app age limit of 13 years old min. Please make age limit clear - he was very disappointed having cleared other apps to be able to install."
"I've played this gam for years, finally bit the bullet and paid to have ads removed. They then had their update with the back button and extra pieces that you have to watch an ad for. While it's nice I don't have to back out of ads every few minutes, I wish the new update was part of the no ads."
Hi walbon or colaf of beote
The game is good to much updates Tho
"This game is so pay to win... Y'all diamond character chance are too low,😒😒😒 it's so impossible to get fire god liu Kang"

Wow nice game
"The cloud save doesn't work. I can't log in to my Square Enix account to download my save files that I uploaded from my PC version. It only supports whatever you have saved through Google. I really wish you guys would fix this. I payed for the game on Steam, and I payed for it on Google specifically to be able to take advantage of the cross platform saving capability. There is absolutely no point whatsoever in playing this game on my phone if I can't pick up where I left off on my PC."
"Love it, but wish tablet would flipping work!"

I love this game but when are you going to make a talking Becca?
Nice
Add a Halloween skin please
This is so so good creator I love it 😀
Nice game
Game is perfect except the bugs. Everytime I get into a pvp match I getter kicked out because of connection. Which isn't something that should happen because of bad internet. It kicks you out of the game and makes you wait 1 HOUR or 10 minutes. It should just send you back to the pvp menu but it doesn't. Please fix this issue
"Absolutely love the game, but for me having access to the cheats on the pause menu like unlimited hp etc ruins the experience. If I get to a point where I'm not quite strong enough, the temptation just ruins it. I'd rather be forced to play properly to feel that sense of achievement. So unfortunately I'll stick to playing on my ps1"
Wow u guys increased the size of it
IT SUCKS
Fun
Wort game ever you bully me way to much and its ridiculous and I can't take it anymore
"so, cool game I am a football player I am very happy"
Very choppy and slow combat movements.... No way to save your progress in the game..
This game is rubbish when it comes to matching players and the mechanics of the game in h2h. The players respond so slow to the controls. It's not even funny at this point
Nice my mom doesn't let me to play on her phon

"This game will not track any walking progress despite the game being open and given all permissions. I have done all troubleshooting suggested to no avail. I am dissapointed, as this game used to work fine in the past, but after returning there is no way to progress meaningfully anymore due to this bug. I have uninstalled, logged out, reatarted, and granted access 8 times without results. I talked online and found many others with this issue for years. Fix. Your. Game."
My favorite game!

Can't even register. It said my mobile number has security risk and I really don't know how to fix it. Maybe it's not accepting new intl users now:(

"It is very beautiful, and I also played and created an email on it, and it is really wonderful, but the problem of the lag, I hope to solve it as soon as possible 😭❤"
Awesome
Good
So far so good
"One of, if not the most iconic RPGs in the history of video games. The nostalgia is amazing, going from 3 discs on PS1 to your phone is always amazing."
I thougt it will not run in my 2 gb ram low end device but surprisingly it's running in highest graphix smoothly in my mobile i love this game. Game is worth it.
"Add battle pass and better shooting input in pvp. Using my Razer Kishi sucks as I try to trace and shoot. The bullets have a delay. If you want more money add battle pass for premium weapons, armor, and skins. Update your tweets. That's how most gamers find out about game updates."
It is cool
"Used to enjoy this game. I paid for the ad free version but got ripped off. Still have ads. Good game, lousy business"
Trash
"I've played this game for years. My record stood at 74,000 for many years! Problem now is the new safety nets they've added to support adverts has made the game too easy. I can always get myself out of trouble. Current score 133,000 and cruising. I liked the brutal structure of only having 1 life. I feel like everyone with a little skill will be banging out 100,000 scores."
This is very good game
♥️
Improve more
It's amazing game
"It's an amazing game, it's glitching alot especially when I'm fighting in the top 10 or I'm firing at an enemy. Please 🙏🏽 can the glitches be fixed. The freezing got even worst after adjusting the graphics lower."
Nice

"I don't like the penguin logo, it's seems too cold"
It keeps saying loading player data on every game
"Do not download this app!! , i repeat , it closed my phone and i almost lost it..."
Fun game
I would love this game I already know it but I'm actually kinda mad that I can't download it idk why even Plz change that
Keeps closing out on me
Fun! Fun!
Great depth for fun
I like it 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🥸😎😎😎😎😎
Good
Fantastic
I just love this game (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃( ◜‿◝ )♡

It's lots of fun though

ALL I NEED IS MY BODY🔪😵
"First you mess with the controls a bunch and now I can't even use skins I downloaded because it isn't a skin silly, IVE USED THIS SKIN FOR YEARS!"
I don't like it now. It was good back then why did you have to change it I'm getting this a one star. Only people play if their try hards at the game. So please fix the game
Best game I've ever played edit nvm that was two years ago and now the game trash
Playing on a razor phone should be able to handle more fps
Thank you minecraft update
Really good
Would have been 5 stars but I lost original game and had to start again
I paid for the ad free version and for the black theme a few years ago but one of the updates removed my access to the theme. Also all of the updates this past year have made the game so much worse and are obvious cash grabs
Best game 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Love cars
Bad experience
Nice game
👍👍
Terrible with updates and permission demands makes game almost not playable getting glitches are way more lagging and raid glitches are a everyday error battles with team rockets are ridiculous with glitches natintic needs to be checked for proper programming and people who will do there job not patches game devolvements are heading away from core game now almost completely new game
I wants to win
It's good but very lagy try making it less lagy ;)
I LOVE IT
I downloaded it and it is not even opening it stucks on downloading necessary data and gives me 2 error - not compatible accessories and waiting for WiFi + it freezes my phone i cant play it such a waste of net
"UPDATE: Beautifully minimalist UI & gamplay factored heavily into my 5-star review. Re-installed 1010! after a 2-3 year break, played one game, and immediately got rid of it. I'll give it 2-stars for the joy it used to bring :( ORIGINAL REVIEW: Loved tetris growing up. Although this gameplay is different, it's still highly addictive! The awesome thing is the game will always give you pieces you need/ can use; your job is to figure out where. What's your high score?"
Fun game but too many ads
"This game us fun it has a lot of challenging racing and i like it. But there is just one thing you must put more custom upgrades and customize body kits, rims ect."
enjoyable 😉
So far so good
"Gain 50% xp by watching ad is not working, whenever I click that icon it freezes my game"
Unplayable. It says insufficient storage and bad networking despite I already have enough free storage space and good network. I've tried everything of these methods on how to get in and it isn't working. God damm please fix your game
good game so funny game 😁😁😂😂😀😍😍😘
You gays destroyed the game I don't know why but this is the badest update 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
"I like this game a lot, but with the new heroes coming in, the old ones are very weak. Please revmap a hero like Gusion and make tinted mirage for him, Or other heroes that are not used"
Good
"Well I made a website on this and that helps me be a pay to play so thanks, you guys get a 5 star because you helped me make money"
"I love this game dgmw, but when I bought Odette in the market I used the black coins u can get in the labyrinth, when I purchased it I don't see my Odette. Please fix this glitch. / bug. It's pretty annoying and to think many people experienced this.. Even if I try to reload/exit and go to the game, I couldn't see my Odette. If only I could show a video as proof. I love you mlbb. I hope this gets fixed!"
Game do not login
Not soo good
Awesome
ليست سيئة 😊
Game kok ngelag trss pintunya gak bisa dibuka
"Use to be great before Zynga bought it. Ads are now forced on you even if you don't use their dumb ""power ups."" I found an older version and will keep that installed."
Been playing this game since I was a kid I love it
Best game
cant log in. tried so hard explaining every single text. if you dont want non china people from using it then why post it on play store dumbass
Pls help my account is not logging it saying incorrect password or username
Please add Classic Controls!
Cool game
funny
Is it fun 😊
I love this game you guys did a great job 😁.
Is sonic.exe in game
My favorite game so far would totally recommend if you wanna play something easy or if you want a challenge.
Love the changes and the new limited edition background options. Thank you!
"Like the game of course, but the aggressive ads are ridiculous. Four verifications to end an ad is beyond absurd. You do realize we can emulate this with a rom with way more functionality, right? There is a limit to monetizing old stuff, and this app exceeds that limit"
It is a cool game so fun I play every day I can not go 1 day with out playing
Best moba game ever. But matchmaking take a long time to load.
"The good: The game and all the minigames are fun to play for months. The developers keep expanding the game. The bad: It turns into an idle/login game grindfest for weeks or months at a time once you get past the first 15 or so levels. The ugly: The ad removal battle pass is a 2 week subscription service, costs more than most other games, and can't be purchased with in-game currency. If you spend over $50 on a mobile game, you shouldn't ever have to watch ads again."
This is a predatory app that constantly tries to force your kid into buying the talking top 2 app. Garbage!
Lose 11 ranked games the matchmaking is so broken when your on a losing streak the game will give you a team that is also on a losing streak... I just came back on my exam and yet this game is treating as if I wasn't welcome here anymore or something I'm probably sure it wasn't like this last season. But meh your game is dying anyways. Da best part for me is to go back to mobile legends sorry your game trash and I hope u fix it.
Super
Nice 👍
"Thank you for the response about player progression. I would also spend more on it if there was currency to lose or earn from other players. For example, if it costs you $1,500 to play and eventually you lose all your money by buying into too many games and not winning any. Not only would players need to earn that money, wait an amount of time, or pay for it if decided. But each game you'd get a chance to win cash based on how much total rent received to play a few more times. Get rich or lose."
Works better than Vice City. Carl can climb obstacles and hes good with an smg.
"It seems to run fine on my oneplus6t tmobile version however even with a moga bluetooth controller the screen is still letterbox blue background with those ugly control overlays present. This is a deal breaker. ePSXe and retroArch emus already have multiple resolution options on mobile. This port has NONE. Ive requested a refund. A phone is small enough. How to we enjoy the nostalgia with that horrible overlay and letterbox? The control overlay still crosses into screen, Y not fullscreen then?"
Very good
good
The game was very good So handsome
"According to me,this is one of the best games I've played as a gamer.Thnx 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲....."
